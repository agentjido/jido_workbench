# AGENTS.md - Jido Workbench

## Commands
- **Setup:** `mix setup` (deps, assets)
- **Run server:** `mix phx.server` or `iex -S mix phx.server`
- **Test all:** `mix test`
- **Single test:** `mix test test/path/to/test_file.exs:LINE`
- **Format:** `mix format`
- **Lint:** `mix credo`

## Architecture
Phoenix 1.7+ LiveView app showcasing the Jido AI Agent Framework. Deployed to Fly.io.
- `lib/agent_jido/` - Core business logic (blog, documentation, agents, chat)
- `lib/agent_jido_web/` - Phoenix web layer (LiveViews, controllers, components)
- `config/` - Environment configs (dev.exs, test.exs, prod.exs, runtime.exs)
- Uses `jido` and `jido_ai` for AI agent functionality; set `LOCAL_JIDO_DEPS=true` for local dev

## Code Style
- Format with `mix format`; use `@doc`/`@moduledoc` and `@spec` on public functions
- snake_case functions/variables, PascalCase modules
- Keep controllers thin; business logic in contexts under `lib/agent_jido/`
- Use changesets for validation; parameterized Ecto queries to prevent SQL injection
- Never log secrets; use `config/runtime.exs` for runtime secrets

## Authentication

- **Always** handle authentication flow at the router level with proper redirects
- **Always** be mindful of where to place routes. `phx.gen.auth` creates multiple router plugs and `live_session` scopes:
  - A plug `:fetch_current_scope_for_user` that is included in the default browser pipeline
  - A plug `:require_authenticated_user` that redirects to the log in page when the user is not authenticated
  - A `live_session :current_user` scope - for routes that need the current user but don't require authentication, similar to `:fetch_current_scope_for_user`
  - A `live_session :require_authenticated_user` scope - for routes that require authentication, similar to the plug with the same name
  - In both cases, a `@current_scope` is assigned to the Plug connection and LiveView socket
  - A plug `redirect_if_user_is_authenticated` that redirects to a default path in case the user is authenticated - useful for a registration page that should only be shown to unauthenticated users
- **Always let the user know in which router scopes, `live_session`, and pipeline you are placing the route, AND SAY WHY**
- `phx.gen.auth` assigns the `current_scope` assign - it **does not assign a `current_user` assign**
- Always pass the assign `current_scope` to context modules as first argument. When performing queries, use `current_scope.user` to filter the query results
- To derive/access `current_user` in templates, **always use the `@current_scope.user`**, never use **`@current_user`** in templates or LiveViews
- **Never** duplicate `live_session` names. A `live_session :current_user` can only be defined __once__ in the router, so all routes for the `live_session :current_user`  must be grouped in a single block
- Anytime you hit `current_scope` errors or the logged in session isn't displaying the right content, **always double check the router and ensure you are using the correct plug and `live_session` as described below**

### Routes that require authentication

LiveViews that require login should **always be placed inside the __existing__ `live_session :require_authenticated_user` block**:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      live_session :require_authenticated_user,
        on_mount: [{AgentJidoWeb.UserAuth, :require_authenticated}] do
        # phx.gen.auth generated routes
        live "/users/settings", UserLive.Settings, :edit
        live "/users/settings/confirm-email/:token", UserLive.Settings, :confirm_email
        # our own routes that require logged in user
        live "/", MyLiveThatRequiresAuth, :index
      end
    end

Controller routes must be placed in a scope that sets the `:require_authenticated_user` plug:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      get "/", MyControllerThatRequiresAuth, :index
    end

### Routes that work with or without authentication

LiveViews that can work with or without authentication, **always use the __existing__ `:current_user` scope**, ie:

    scope "/", MyAppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser]

      live_session :current_user,
        on_mount: [{AgentJidoWeb.UserAuth, :mount_current_scope}] do
        # our own routes that work with or without authentication
        live "/", PublicLive
      end
    end

Controllers automatically have the `current_scope` available if they use the `:browser` pipeline.
