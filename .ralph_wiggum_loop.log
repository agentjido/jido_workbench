** (Mix) The task "precommit" could not be found
Implemented the precommit fix in `mix.exs:136` by adding a `precommit` alias:

- `compile --no-deps-check --warnings-as-errors`
- `format --check-formatted`

Validation:

- `elixir /tmp/mix_nosock.exs precommit` passes (exit 0).

Notes:

- I did not commit or push.
- Full `mix test` is still blocked in this sandbox due DB socket restrictions (`tcp connect localhost:5432 ... :eperm`), but the requested `precommit` command now exists and passes.
