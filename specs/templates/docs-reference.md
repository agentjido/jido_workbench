# `[MODULE NAME]`

## Overview

<!-- What does this module do and when would you use it? 1-2 paragraphs.
     This is the context that HexDocs @moduledoc often lacks. -->

[WHAT THIS MODULE DOES, WHEN TO USE IT, AND WHERE IT FITS IN THE JIDO ARCHITECTURE. Be direct — "This module defines the agent behaviour and provides the macros for creating new agent types."]

---

## Public API

<!-- Functions with arities and one-line descriptions. Must match current source
     (content-governance.md §10). Only include public functions. -->

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[FUNCTION]/[ARITY]` | [ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION] |
| `[FUNCTION]/[ARITY]` | [ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION] |
| `[FUNCTION]/[ARITY]` | [ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION] |
| `[FUNCTION]/[ARITY]` | [ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION] |

## Configuration

<!-- Table of configuration options. Only include if the module has runtime or
     compile-time configuration. Omit this section if not applicable. -->

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `:[KEY]` | `[TYPE]` | `[DEFAULT]` | [WHAT IT CONTROLS] |
| `:[KEY]` | `[TYPE]` | `[DEFAULT]` | [WHAT IT CONTROLS] |

## Types and Specs

<!-- Key typespecs that users need to know about. Show the actual typespec syntax. -->

```elixir
@type [TYPE_NAME] :: [DEFINITION]

## Examples

<!-- 2-3 practical examples showing common usage. Under 30 lines each.
     Must compile (content-governance.md §10). -->

### [EXAMPLE TITLE — e.g., "Creating an Agent"]

```elixir
[RUNNABLE CODE]

  ============================================================
  PUBLISHING CHECKLIST (content-governance.md §10)
  Remove this block before publishing.
  ============================================================

  Before publishing:
  [ ] Package references are real
  [ ] Code examples compile — real modules, functions, correct arities
  [ ] Links resolve — all routes exist
  [ ] Claims are bounded
  [ ] CTA is present and routed
  [ ] Voice check — technical reference tone
  [ ] Cross-link chain — forward (training/build) and backward (concepts/ecosystem)

  Docs-specific checks:
  [ ] API references match current module signatures
  [ ] Configuration keys are valid
  [ ] Types match current typespecs
  [ ] Function arities are correct
