# Voice, Tone, and Style Guide

Version: 1.0  
Last updated: 2026-02-12  
Positioning anchor: `Jido is a runtime for reliable, multi-agent systems.`

## Register

Technical and direct. Write for a senior engineer evaluating tools on a weekday, not a conference keynote audience. Default to showing before telling — code examples, architecture diagrams, and concrete behavior over abstract claims.

## Point of View

Address the reader as "you." Reference teams and organizations as "teams" or "your team." Jido is "Jido" on first use per page, then "it" or "the runtime."

## What We Sound Like

- A thoughtful staff engineer explaining an architecture decision to a peer.
- Confident in what we've built but honest about tradeoffs.
- Specific over vague. "Supervision restarts crashed agents" over "built-in resilience."

## What We Do Not Sound Like

- Marketing copy that could describe any product. No "unlock the power of" or "supercharge your workflow."
- Insider shorthand. Write "Elixir/OTP's process isolation" not "let it crash" without context.
- Breathless hype. No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "the future of."

## Technical Depth by Section

- **Features / Ecosystem:** Concept-first, then one code example per capability. Enough to evaluate, not enough to implement.
- **Build / Docs:** Code-first. Show the implementation, then explain why it works that way.
- **Training:** Pedagogical. Build concepts incrementally. Every code block should be runnable.
- **Community:** Outcome-first. Show what teams achieved and how they got there.

## Comparison and Competitor References

Name competitors when the comparison is specific and technical (e.g., "Unlike CrewAI's prompt-chain model, Jido uses typed signals for inter-agent communication"). Use category labels ("prototype-first frameworks") when making general positioning claims. Never disparage — frame as fit-for-purpose differences.

## Code Example Conventions

- Use realistic module and function names, not `Foo` or `MyApp`.
- Keep examples under 30 lines when inline; link to full examples for longer code.
- Always show the result or output, not just the setup.
- Prefer examples from the Jido ecosystem packages (jido, jido_ai, jido_action, jido_signal).

## Style and Mechanical Conventions

### Terminology and Capitalization
- Jido — always capitalized, never "JIDO" or "jido" in prose (only lowercase in code/package names)
- BEAM — always all-caps
- OTP — always all-caps
- Elixir/OTP — use this compound form when referencing the platform advantage
- LiveView — one word, capital L capital V
- Phoenix — capitalized
- GenServer — capital G, capital S
- multi-agent — hyphenated as adjective ("multi-agent systems"), no hyphen as noun where applicable
- runtime-first — hyphenated when used as compound adjective
- tool-calling — hyphenated as adjective
- fault-tolerant — hyphenated
- open-source — hyphenated as adjective, "open source" as noun
- hex.pm — lowercase
- agentjido.xyz — lowercase
- HexDocs — one word, capital H capital D

### Jido-Specific Terms (use consistently)
- Action (capitalized when referring to the Jido concept, e.g., "define an Action")
- Signal (capitalized when referring to the Jido concept)
- Directive (capitalized when referring to the Jido concept)
- Agent (capitalized when referring to a Jido Agent specifically, lowercase for general "agent" concept)
- Sensor (capitalized for Jido concept)
- Plugin (capitalized for Jido concept)
- Strategy (capitalized for Jido concept — orchestration strategies)
- Workflow — lowercase unless starting a sentence; this is a general concept, not a Jido-specific type
- Runtime — lowercase unless starting a sentence; describes Jido's operational model

### Headings
- Use sentence case for all headings ("Getting started with signals" not "Getting Started With Signals")
- Exception: proper nouns and Jido-specific terms remain capitalized in headings ("Getting started with Jido Signals")

### Code Blocks
- Always specify the language: ```elixir, ```bash, ```json, etc.
- Use `iex>` prefix for interactive examples
- Use `$` prefix for shell commands
- Always show expected output when demonstrating behavior
- Keep inline examples under 30 lines; link to full source for longer
- Use realistic module names from the Jido ecosystem, never `Foo`, `Bar`, `MyModule`
- Dependency examples always use Hex format: `{:jido, "~> 1.0"}`

### Links
- Internal cross-links: use relative paths (`/docs/guides/...`)
- Package references: link to hex.pm (`https://hex.pm/packages/jido`)
- API references: link to HexDocs (`https://hexdocs.pm/jido`)
- Ecosystem overview: link to agentjido.xyz
- Never link to internal workspace files, GitHub source, or contributor-only paths in public content

### Status Labels (for pre-release / maturity)
- Use these exact labels when describing package maturity:
  - **Stable** — API is settled, suitable for production use
  - **Beta** — functional and usable, API may change
  - **Experimental** — early development, expect breaking changes
  - **Planned** — not yet implemented
- Always include a status label on ecosystem/package pages
- Never describe an experimental package using production-confidence language

### Structural Conventions
- Use bullet lists for 3+ items; use prose for 1-2 items
- Use tables for comparisons and structured data
- Use admonition blocks (> **Note:**, > **Warning:**, > **Tip:**) sparingly — max 2 per page
- Every page needs a clear "what's next" link at the bottom
- Prerequisites go at the top, before content

### Avoided Phrases
- "Unlock the power of" / "supercharge" / "turbocharge"
- "Revolutionary" / "game-changing" / "the future of"
- "Simply" / "just" / "easily" (implies trivial, alienates struggling readers)
- "Production-ready" without specific evidence backing the claim
- "Best-in-class" / "world-class" / "enterprise-grade" (empty superlatives)
- "Let it crash" without explaining what it means for non-BEAM readers
- "Users" — say "you" or "teams" instead

### Primary CTA Convention
- Default CTA across the site: **Get Building**
- Section-specific alternatives: "Start Training", "Explore Features", "See the Ecosystem"
- CTA must always link to a real, populated destination
