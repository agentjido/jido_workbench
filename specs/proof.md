# Jido Proof Inventory

Version: 1.0  
Last updated: 2026-02-28  
Primary inputs: `specs/positioning.md` §9 (Messaging Pillars), §7 (Persona Coverage), §8 (Ecosystem Proof Architecture)

> **Purpose:** Map every positioning claim to concrete, verifiable proof. If a cell is empty, the claim is unsupported. Fill this in before publishing any major page.
>
> **Rule from positioning.md §8:** Every pillar must reference at least one package, one runnable example, and one training module.

## Summary Scorecard

| Pillar | Training modules | Runnable examples | Operational demos | Reference docs | Architecture diagrams |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Reliability | 🟡 2 partial | 🟡 1 exists, 1 missing | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 2 — Coordination | ✅ 3 exist | 🟡 1 exists, 2 missing | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 3 — Operations | 🟡 1 partial | 🟡 1 exists | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |
| 4 — Composable | ✅ 2 exist | ❌ 0 purpose-built | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 | ❌ 0 |

**Honest assessment:** Training module briefs and ecosystem docs provide a foundation, but there are zero operational demos, zero purpose-built reference docs, and zero architecture diagrams. The proof is light across every pillar. Content plan briefs exist for most gaps — the work is converting briefs into finished assets.

## Priority TODO List

_Ranked by positioning impact × effort._

1. ❌ **Failure drill demo** (Pillar 1) — Single most impactful proof for reliability claim
2. ❌ **Signal routing multi-agent demo** (Pillar 2) — Proves coordination is real
3. ❌ **Dashboard instrumentation walkthrough** (Pillar 3) — Proves observability is real
4. ❌ **Package matrix** (Pillar 4) — Foundational reference for composability claim
5. ❌ **Minimal-stack quickstart** (Pillar 4) — Proves incremental adoption
6. ❌ **Why BEAM comparison** (Cross-cutting) — Unlocks Python/TS persona journeys
7. ❌ **Telemetry event catalog** (Pillar 3) — SRE persona table stakes
8. ❌ **Production runbook** (Pillar 1 + 3) — Operability proof
9. ❌ **Mixed-stack integration demo** (Cross-cutting) — Polyglot persona proof
10. ❌ **End-to-end tool-calling example** (Pillar 2) — AI product engineer entry point
