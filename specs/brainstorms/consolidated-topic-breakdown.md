# Consolidated Content Topic Breakdown

Date: 2026-02-22
Status: Review draft — for discussion before any new briefs are created

Sources:
- Current `priv/content_plan` inventory (76 pages)
- `priv/content_plan/gap-analysis-vs-agent-framework-doc-model.md`
- `specs/brainstorms/proposed-content-topics-2.0.md`

---

## How to read this

Every topic below is either **existing** (already in `priv/content_plan`) or **proposed new** (from the gap analysis / 2.0 planning). Existing pages are grouped under the theme they naturally belong to, regardless of their current section folder. Proposed new topics are marked with `[NEW]` and show where they'd land.

Priority tiers:
- **P0** — positioning-critical; if this is missing or weak, evaluators get the wrong picture of Jido
- **P1** — production-confidence; needed to back up reliability/ops claims
- **P2** — ecosystem breadth; important but not blocking core narrative
- **Stub** — roadmap mention only for 2.0; no deep brief yet

## 1. Onboarding and First Value

> Goal: Three progressive build guides that take a builder from zero to orchestrated workflows. Each one stands alone but they form a clear ladder: pure runtime → LLM agent → workflow orchestration. The sequence makes the "LLM optional" positioning self-evident through structure, not just messaging.

| # | Topic | Status | File / Placement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Installation and Setup | review | `build/installation.md` | P0 | Near-ready; needs cross-link to the three-guide sequence below |
| 1.2 | Build Your First Agent (no LLM) | review | `build/first-agent.md` | P0 | **Guide 1.** Explicitly no-LLM. Pure runtime primitives: define agent schema, write actions, handle signals, run via AgentServer. Proves the runtime works without any model dependency. |
| 1.3 | `[NEW]` Build Your First LLM Agent | — | `build/first-llm-agent.md` | P0 | **Guide 2.** Uses `jido_ai` (`Jido.AI.Agent` / ReAct reasoning). Configure API keys, define a tool-calling agent, show structured output. Direct comparison to guide 1 — same coordination model, intelligence added. |
| 1.4 | `[NEW]` Build Your First Workflow | — | `build/first-workflow.md` | P0 | **Guide 3.** Uses `jido_runic` to compose ActionNodes into a DAG-based workflow. Demonstrates multi-step orchestration with signal gating, strategy integration, and directive-driven execution. Source material: `jido_runic/lib/examples/` (studio pipeline, branching, delegating demos). |
| 1.5 | Getting Started Docs Hub | outline | `docs/getting-started.md` | P0 | Navigation page routing 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → concepts |
| 1.6 | Docs Overview | outline | `docs/overview.md` | P0 | Top-level docs entry point |
| 1.7 | Quickstarts by Persona | outline | `build/quickstarts-by-persona.md` | P1 | Role-specific fast paths |
| 1.8 | `[NEW]` Why Not Just a GenServer? | — | `build/why-not-just-a-genserver.md` | P1 | Progressive complexity walkthrough based on `req_llm/lib/examples/` (GenServer agent with streaming, tool calling, conversation history, multi-model support). Shows how building a production-grade agent from raw GenServer + ReqLLM accumulates complexity that Jido's primitives handle by design. Bridges the ReqLLM → Jido adoption path. |

---

## 2. Core Primitives and Concepts

> Goal: Canonical explainers for every Jido primitive. These are the "what is it and how does it work" pages.

| # | Topic | Status | File / Placement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Key Concepts | draft | `docs/key-concepts.md` | P0 | Foundation page; add "LLM optional by design" framing (TOPIC-001) |
| 2.2 | Core Concepts Hub | outline | `docs/core-concepts.md` | P0 | Navigation hub for 2.3–2.8 |
| 2.3 | Agents | draft | `docs/agents.md` | P0 | |

| 2.5 | Signals | draft | `docs/signals.md` | P0 | |
| 2.6 | Directives | outline | `docs/directives.md` | P0 | |
| 2.7 | Plugins | outline | `docs/plugins.md` | P1 | |
| 2.8 | Agent Runtime (AgentServer) | draft | `docs/agent-server.md` | P0 | Critical for runtime-first story |
| 2.9 | Glossary | draft | `docs/glossary.md` | P1 | Terminology alignment |
| 2.10 | Guides Docs Hub | outline | `docs/guides.md` | P1 | Navigation page for guides section |

## 7. Security and Governance

> Goal: Define scope boundaries clearly — what Jido controls vs platform/Phoenix/Ash — without over-promising enterprise depth.

| # | Topic | Status | File / Placement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Security and Governance | outline | `docs/security-and-governance.md` | P0 | Expand with shared-responsibility model + scope boundary (TOPIC-009) |
| 7.2 | Content Governance and Drift Detection | outline | `docs/content-governance-and-drift-detection.md` | P2 | |

---

## 8. Observability and Debugging

> Goal: Connect telemetry, debugging, and troubleshooting into a coherent ops story. Lean heavily on three concrete proof surfaces: **jido_studio** (LiveView-based observability UI, tracing, runtime inspection), **jido_otel** (OpenTelemetry bridge — converts Jido event prefixes to OTel spans), and **BEAM tooling** (`:observer`, `:recon`, process inspection, supervision tree visualization). These are the "show don't tell" anchors for the ops-first pillar.

| # | Topic | Status | File / Placement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Production Telemetry (feature page) | published | `features/operations-observability.md` | — | Done |
| 8.2 | Telemetry and Observability Reference | draft | `docs/telemetry-and-observability.md` | P1 | Expand to cover: jido_otel span mapping, jido_studio dashboards, BEAM-native tooling (`:observer`, `:recon`, process introspection). These three layers form the observability stack. |
| 8.3 | Troubleshooting and Debugging Playbook | outline | `docs/troubleshooting-and-debugging-playbook.md` | P1 | Reference jido_studio tracing and BEAM debugging workflows as concrete procedures |
| 8.4 | LiveView Integration Patterns (feature page) | published | `features/liveview-integration-patterns.md` | — | Done |

| 15.2 | Examples Inventory | outline | `examples/overview.md` | P2 | |

---

## 16. Roadmap Stubs Only (no deep brief in 2.0)

> These get a "Coming Soon" mention on the Roadmap page (15.1) but no dedicated content brief yet.

| # | Topic | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16.1 | Evaluation and Quality Gates | TOPIC-011 | No eval system exists yet |
| 16.2 | `jido_cluster` Reliability | TOPIC-012 | Package does not exist in ecosystem yet — future/planned name only |
| 16.3 | `jido_bedrock` Reliability | TOPIC-013 | Package does not exist in ecosystem yet — future/planned name only |
| 16.4 | `jido_studio` Observability UI | TOPIC-014 | Package not ready |
| 16.5 | Performance and Cost Profiling | TOPIC-015 | Tooling doesn't exist yet; add "Coming Soon" section to telemetry page (8.2) |
| 16.6 | Streaming and Interruption Semantics | Gap analysis P1 | No runtime support for dedicated docs yet |
| 16.7 | Voice / Multimodal | Gap analysis P2 | Low priority for current thesis |
| 16.8 | Build-vs-Buy Decision Guide | Gap analysis P2 | After core runtime docs are publish-ready |
| 16.9 | Deep Enterprise RBAC/Tenancy/Compliance | Gap analysis | Out of scope; shared-responsibility boundary only |

## Proposed New Briefs Summary

13 new content plan briefs to create (if you approve):

**P0 (positioning-critical):**

| Brief file | Theme | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `build/first-llm-agent.md` | 1. Onboarding | Guide 2: jido_ai ReAct agent |
| `build/first-workflow.md` | 1. Onboarding | Guide 3: jido_runic DAG workflows |
| `docs/provider-capability-and-fallback-matrix.md` | 5. AI/Model Integration | TOPIC-005 |
| `docs/ai-integration-decision-guide.md` | 3. Architecture | TOPIC-006 |
| `features/roadmap-and-known-gaps.md` | 15. Transparency | TOPIC-008 |
| `docs/reference-jido-runic.md` | 12. Package Refs | Primary workflow package |

**P1 (production-confidence):**

| Brief file | Theme | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `build/why-not-just-a-genserver.md` | 1. Onboarding | ReqLLM GenServer agent complexity walkthrough |
| `build/behavior-tree-without-llm.md` | 4. Build Guides | TOPIC-003 (deprioritized from P0) |

| `docs/reference-jido-otel.md` | 12. Package Refs | Public package, no brief |
| `docs/reference-jido-behaviortree.md` | 12. Package Refs | Public package, no brief |

Internal governance doc (not a published page — lives in `specs/`, not `priv/content_plan`):
- `specs/reference-completeness-plan.md` — defines "done" criteria for each package reference (TOPIC-007)

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (apply to all topics)

From TOPIC-001 and TOPIC-004 — these are **not standalone pages** but expansions woven into existing briefs:

1. **"LLM optional by design"** — thread into: key-concepts, architecture-overview, getting-started, first-agent, features/overview, quickstarts-by-persona
2. **ReqLLM first-class visibility** — thread into: composable-ecosystem, reference-req-llm, reference-jido-ai, ai-chat-agent, tool-use, package-matrix
3. **LLMDB.xyz mentions** — thread into: provider-capability matrix, reference-req-llm, configuration
4. **Runtime-first language primary** — every page; model layer stays optional framing

---

## Suggested Execution Sequence

### Wave 1: Positioning-critical hardening (P0)
1. **Onboarding ladder:** Finalize first-agent (no-LLM baseline), create first-llm-agent (jido_ai), create first-workflow (jido_runic)
2. Finalize existing P0 concept pages: architecture-overview, key-concepts, agents, actions, signals, directives, agent-server, production-readiness-checklist
3. Create new briefs: ai-integration-decision-guide, provider-capability matrix, roadmap-and-known-gaps, reference-jido-runic
4. Expand security-and-governance with shared-responsibility scope boundary
5. Thread "LLM optional" and ReqLLM visibility across existing pages

### Wave 2: Production-confidence completion (P1)
1. Create: why-not-just-a-genserver, behavior-tree-without-llm, mcp-integration, backup-and-disaster-recovery
2. Create package refs: reference-jido-memory, reference-jido-otel, reference-jido-behaviortree
3. Finalize: retries/backpressure, telemetry (expand with jido_otel + jido_studio + BEAM tooling), troubleshooting, incident playbooks, testing
4. Upgrade remaining package reference stubs to full API contract pages
5. Finalize: ai-chat-agent, tool-use, multi-agent-workflows
6. Create `specs/reference-completeness-plan.md` as internal governance doc

### Wave 3: Ecosystem breadth (P2)
1. Reference architectures, product blueprints, mixed-stack runbooks
2. Adoption playbooks, case studies, learning paths
3. Cookbook recipes
4. Build-vs-buy guidance (if warranted)
