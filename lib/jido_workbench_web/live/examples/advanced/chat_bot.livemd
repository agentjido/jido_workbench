# Building a Chat Bot Agent

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a more sophisticated chat bot agent that maintains conversation context and can handle complex interactions.

## Architecture

The chat bot uses the following components:
- Memory store for conversation history
- NLP processing for intent recognition
- Context management for maintaining state

## Implementation

Here's the basic structure:

```elixir
defmodule ChatBotAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "ChatBot",
    description: "An intelligent chat bot agent",
    actions: [
      ChatBotAgent.Actions.ProcessMessage,
      ChatBotAgent.Actions.ManageContext
    ]
end
```

## Advanced Features

- Context awareness
- Memory management
- Natural language processing
- Dynamic response generation
