# Jido Architecture Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Jido's architecture and design principles.

## System Components

### Agent System

The agent system is built on top of OTP and provides:
- Supervision trees
- State management
- Message passing
- Fault tolerance

### Action Framework

Actions are implemented as behaviours:
```elixir
defmodule MyAction do
  use Jido.Action

  def execute(params, context) do
    # Implementation
  end
end
```

### Skill System

Skills provide reusable capabilities:
- Modular design
- Composable functionality
- Versioning support

## Best Practices

- Follow OTP principles
- Use supervision strategies
- Implement proper error handling
- Design for scalability
