## What you'll learn

- How to wire LiveView events to agent command execution
- How to keep UI state aligned with immutable agent outputs
- How to display side effects (emit/schedule) transparently to users
- How to avoid race-prone state updates in interactive flows

## Prerequisites

- You are comfortable with `handle_event/3` in LiveView
- You can read Phoenix templates and assigns
- You understand optimistic and confirmed UI update tradeoffs

## Lesson Breakdown

1. **Command boundary**: map each UI intent to a single agent command.
2. **State rendering**: render from the latest agent struct only.
3. **Directive visibility**: surface emitted/scheduled work in UI logs.
4. **Concurrency handling**: guard against stale events and rapid clicks.
5. **Testing**: verify DOM updates from known state transitions.

## Hands-on Exercise

Build a LiveView for the demand tracker:

1. Initialize an agent in `mount/3`.
2. Add `Boost`, `Cool`, and `Toggle Auto Decay` buttons.
3. On click, call the agent command and assign the new state.
4. Render a recent-events panel from emitted directive metadata.
5. Add a LiveView test asserting key state and labels change correctly.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every UI action maps to an explicit agent command.
- [ ] Socket assigns hold the latest immutable agent state.
- [ ] Directive outcomes are visible for debugging.
- [ ] LiveView tests cover at least one multi-step user flow.
