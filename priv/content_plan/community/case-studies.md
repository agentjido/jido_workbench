## Content Brief

Template-driven case study content showing context, architecture, outcomes, and operational lessons.

### Validation Criteria

- Includes baseline metrics and post-adoption outcomes
- Includes explicit architecture and runbook links
- Includes constraints and lessons learned, not only wins
