## Content Brief

Canonical checklist and standards page for public Jido ecosystem packages. This should be usable as both a contributor handoff document and an agent-verifiable policy page.

### Validation Criteria

- Includes a fast review path near the top
- Distinguishes quality standards from support level and package roster pages
- Covers repo structure, quality gates, docs coverage, CI, and release workflow
- Captures worktree-safe git hook and local tooling expectations
- States the canonical package policies clearly enough to link from PRs
- Includes actionable checklists, not just prose
