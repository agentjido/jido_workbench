## Content Brief

Section root for Operations. Organizes production operations, reliability, and security guides for running Jido agents in production.

### Validation Criteria

- Each operations guide has a one-line description and link
- Guides are grouped by operational concern (readiness, security, incidents, recovery)
- Hub helps users quickly find the right guide for their production challenge
