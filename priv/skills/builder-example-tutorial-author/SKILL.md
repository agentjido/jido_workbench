# Builder Example or Tutorial Author

Use this skill when the task is to turn package source material into a runnable example page or a docs/tutorial flow in the workbench.

## Workflow

1. Extract the smallest truthful workflow from the package source.
2. Decide whether the work belongs as an example, tutorial, cookbook, or reference page.
3. Define the deterministic fixture plan so the surface is testable without external credentials.
4. Produce the content outline, implementation targets, and verification checklist.

## Package Boundary

- Package repo: implementation modules, test fixtures, and public API examples.
- Workbench repo: example page, tutorial copy, live demo surface, and narrative sequencing.

## Deliverables

- example or tutorial outline
- deterministic fixture plan
- implementation and verification checklist
