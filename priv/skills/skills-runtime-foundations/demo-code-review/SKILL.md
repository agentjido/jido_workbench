# Demo Code Review

Use this skill when you want a deterministic review checklist for changed files.

## Workflow

1. Read the modified files.
2. Compare the code against the requested behavior.
3. Flag correctness issues, missing tests, and risky assumptions.
4. Summarize the highest-priority findings first.

## Response Format

1. One-sentence summary of the change
2. Findings ordered by severity
3. Remaining test or rollout risks
