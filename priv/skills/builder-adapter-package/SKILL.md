# Builder Adapter Package

Use this skill when the work is a new adapter or integration package for provider tooling, MCP, browser flows, or workbench interoperability.

## Workflow

1. Define the package boundary, public API, runtime dependencies, and failure modes.
2. Draft the package layout with clear separation between integration edges and core Jido abstractions.
3. Identify the deterministic fixtures or adapters needed for tests and examples.
4. Record the workbench deliverables: ecosystem page, example/tutorial ideas, and migration notes.

## Package Boundary

- Package repo: adapter modules, integration tests, release assets, and compatibility notes.
- Workbench repo: package page, examples/tutorials, and contributor-facing guidance.

## Deliverables

- package boundary map
- adapter package skeleton
- workbench follow-up checklist
