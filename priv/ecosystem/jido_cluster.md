## Overview

Jido Cluster provides a distributed runtime layer for keyed Jido agent instances across multiple BEAM nodes. It adds ownership, routing, and recovery patterns on top of Jido instance management for multi-node deployments.

## Purpose

Jido Cluster is the distributed runtime package for teams running Jido agents beyond a single node.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns distributed instance ownership, node routing, and rebalancing mechanics for keyed agents.
- Provides cluster-aware storage adapter surfaces for cross-node recovery flows.
- Does not replace core agent contracts, action semantics, or provider-specific integration packages.

## Major Components

### Cluster Instance Manager

`Jido.Cluster.InstanceManager` coordinates keyed ownership and lifecycle operations for instances across connected nodes.

### Routing and Ownership

Uses deterministic owner resolution and cross-node call/cast APIs to route operations to the correct runtime node.

### Rebalancing Loop

Includes conservative periodic migration controls so ownership can adapt without aggressive movement.

### Storage Integrations

Provides cluster-friendly storage adapter options for shared persistence in distributed runtime topologies.
