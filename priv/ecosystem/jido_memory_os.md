## Overview

Jido MemoryOS is a tiered memory orchestration layer built on top of `jido_memory` for agent context management. It combines retrieval, lifecycle control, and governance concerns into a coordinated memory operating layer.

## Purpose

Jido MemoryOS provides higher-level memory orchestration for Jido agents that need lifecycle-aware retrieval and policy controls beyond base memory primitives.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns tiered memory lifecycle orchestration, retrieval planning/ranking, and governance controls.
- Integrates with core Jido runtime surfaces through plugin and action entry points.
- Does not replace low-level agent execution contracts or external provider/runtime adapter responsibilities.

## Major Components

### Memory Manager Control Plane

Coordinates queueing, retries, idempotency, and operation scheduling for memory workflows.

### Tiered Lifecycle Model

Manages short/mid/long memory promotion and consolidation with lineage-aware behavior.

### Retrieval and Explainability

Implements retrieval planning, ranking, and explain payload generation for context assembly.

### Governance and Safety

Applies policy enforcement, approvals, retention controls, masking, and auditing around memory operations.
