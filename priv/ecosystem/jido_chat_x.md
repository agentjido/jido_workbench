## Overview

Jido Chat X connects X/Twitter direct messages to the Jido Chat adapter model. It gives Jido Chat workflows a channel-specific path for DM-style communication.

## Purpose

Jido Chat X is the X/Twitter Direct Messages adapter for teams experimenting with agent chat across social messaging surfaces.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns X/Twitter-specific payload mapping and adapter behavior.
- Implements the common Jido Chat adapter shape.
- Does not own platform policy, account permissions, or cross-channel orchestration.

## Major Components

### X Adapter

Wraps X/Twitter direct-message behavior behind the shared Jido Chat adapter contract.

### Event Normalization

Converts platform-native direct-message payloads into normalized chat messages.

### SDK Boundary

Uses the X SDK dependency as the platform access layer while keeping Jido Chat workflows channel-neutral.
