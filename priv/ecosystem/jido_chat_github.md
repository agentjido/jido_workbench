## Overview

Jido Chat GitHub connects GitHub Issues conversations to the Jido Chat adapter model. It gives agent workflows a channel-oriented way to read and respond to issue-driven collaboration.

## Purpose

Jido Chat GitHub is the GitHub Issues transport adapter for teams that want Jido Chat workflows to operate directly in repository issue queues.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns GitHub Issues payload mapping and outbound issue interaction behavior.
- Implements the common Jido Chat adapter shape for channel portability.
- Does not own GitHub project policy, triage decisions, or cross-channel chat contracts.

## Major Components

### GitHub Adapter

Maps GitHub issue data into Jido Chat messages and handles GitHub API calls for channel operations.

### Event Normalization

Normalizes issue payloads into the shared message structures consumed by chat workflows.

### Test Fixtures

Provides fixture-driven coverage for GitHub payload handling and adapter behavior.
