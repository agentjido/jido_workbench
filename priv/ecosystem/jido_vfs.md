## Overview

Jido VFS is the runtime filesystem substrate for the CLI-agent ecosystem. It provides a stable, backend-agnostic contract that higher-level packages build on for safe read/write/list/mutation workflows.

## Purpose

Jido VFS provides the backend-agnostic filesystem contract used by shell, workspace, and harness runtime layers.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns filesystem abstractions, adapter behavior, and safe file-operation primitives.
- Supports multiple backends and execution environments without prescribing agent strategy.
- Does not own CLI session orchestration, provider contracts, or app-level workflow policy.

## Major Components

### Filesystem Contract

Defines the core behavior and data model for backend-agnostic file operations.

### Backend Adapters

Implements concrete adapters that satisfy the contract across local and virtual backends.

### Runtime Safety Primitives

Provides predictable operations used by shell/workspace layers to support autonomous execution.
