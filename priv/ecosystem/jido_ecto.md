## Overview

Jido Ecto provides Ecto-backed persistence adapters for Jido runtimes. It lets teams connect Jido storage behavior to familiar database-backed application infrastructure.

## Purpose

Jido Ecto is the Ecto storage integration package for teams that want database-backed persistence through standard Elixir application patterns.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Ecto-specific persistence adapters and database integration behavior.
- Depends on host application database setup, migrations, and operational policy.
- Does not replace core Jido runtime contracts or define a general storage governance layer.

## Major Components

### Ecto Storage Adapter

Implements Jido persistence behavior on top of Ecto and Ecto SQL.

### Database Test Surface

Exercises adapter behavior against database-backed test dependencies.

### Package Quality Tooling

Includes coverage, Dialyzer, Credo, Doctor, docs, and release metadata for hardening.
