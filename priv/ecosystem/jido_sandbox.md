## Overview

Jido Sandbox is a lightweight, pure-BEAM sandbox designed for safely executing LLM tool calls. It provides an in-memory virtual filesystem (VFS) paired with a hardened Lua scripting runtime, giving AI agents a controlled environment to read, write, and manipulate files without ever touching the real filesystem, network, or operating system.

By combining a fully virtual filesystem with sandboxed Lua execution, Jido Sandbox ensures that LLM-generated code can run freely without risk of side effects. Snapshot and restore capabilities allow agents to experiment with state changes and roll back instantly, enabling safe exploration and speculative execution patterns.

## Purpose

Jido Sandbox serves as the secure execution boundary in the Jido ecosystem. When LLM agents need to perform file operations or execute scripts as part of tool calls, Jido Sandbox provides a completely isolated environment — no real filesystem access, no networking, no shell commands.

## Major Components

### Public API
Top-level module delegating to the core Sandbox struct: `new/1`, `write/3`, `read/2`, `list/2`, `delete/2`, `mkdir/2`, `snapshot/1`, `restore/2`, and `eval_lua/2`.

### VFS
Behaviour-based virtual filesystem with an in-memory implementation storing files as path-to-binary maps. Supports full POSIX-like semantics including parent directory validation and non-empty directory delete protection.

### Path Validation
Security-focused path normalization enforcing absolute paths, blocking traversal attacks, collapsing duplicate slashes, and providing parent/basename utilities.

### Lua Runtime
Restricted Lua environment via the `lua` library with VFS userdata injection, API bindings for the `vfs` namespace, and stripped dangerous globals (`os`, `io`, `package`, `debug`).

### Schemas
Zoi-based input validation for all LLM tool inputs with absolute path requirements, traversal attack blocking, and clear error messages.
