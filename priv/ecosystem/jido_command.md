## Overview

Jido Command is a signal-first command runtime for markdown-defined command catalogs. It lets teams define command behavior in frontmatter-backed documents and invoke commands through API, signal bus, or CLI surfaces.

## Purpose

Jido Command is the slash-command package for structured command execution in Jido-based workflows.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns command registry loading, invocation validation, and command lifecycle signaling.
- Provides command execution surfaces for API calls, signal dispatch, and local CLI usage.
- Does not own general-purpose orchestration, provider-specific adapters, or agent memory/persistence strategy.

## Major Components

### Command Registry

Loads and manages markdown command definitions from configured roots with reload and runtime registration support.

### Validation Pipeline

Validates command names, params, context, and permission maps before invocation.

### Dispatch and Lifecycle Events

Publishes typed command lifecycle events so execution can be observed and integrated through signals.

### CLI Surface

Provides escript and mix-task entry points for invoking, listing, reloading, and monitoring command operations.
