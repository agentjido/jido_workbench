## Overview

Jido Chat Discord is the Discord transport adapter for Jido Chat. It maps Discord events and message operations onto the shared `Jido.Chat.Adapter` contract.

## Purpose

Jido Chat Discord provides Discord-specific ingress and egress behavior while preserving a common chat adapter surface across channels.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Discord payload transformation, listener setup, and transport-specific message operations.
- Implements the shared Jido Chat adapter contract so chat workflows remain portable.
- Does not own cross-channel chat contracts, runtime policy, or non-Discord transport logic.

## Major Components

### Discord Adapter

`Jido.Chat.Discord.Adapter` handles inbound transformation and outbound message execution for Discord channels.

### Ingress Modes

Supports both webhook and gateway ingress modes through `listener_child_specs/2` and configurable event source wiring.

### Event Normalization

Converts Discord-native event structures into normalized typed envelopes used across Jido Chat flows.

### Compatibility Surface

Maintains a compatibility wrapper for legacy channel interfaces during migration to canonical adapter modules.
