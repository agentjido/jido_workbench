## Overview

Jidoka is an experimental agent harness and DSL layer built on Jido and Jido AI. It explores higher-level composition patterns for agent views, guardrails, and workflow runtime behavior.

## Purpose

Jidoka is for proving out developer-friendly agent-building patterns above the lower-level Jido runtime and package stack.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns its DSL, guardrail, AgentView, and harness-level runtime composition.
- Depends on core Jido, AI, memory, browser, MCP, and workflow packages.
- Does not define the canonical low-level Jido runtime contracts.

## Major Components

### Agent DSL

Provides higher-level authoring surfaces for defining agent behavior.

### Guardrails

Includes input, output, and tool guardrail modules for runtime boundaries.

### AgentView And Tracing

Explores observability and capture patterns for understanding agent execution.
