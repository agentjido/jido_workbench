## Overview

Jido Live Dashboard is a real-time observability and debugging toolkit for the Jido agent ecosystem, built as a native extension to Phoenix LiveDashboard. A single call to `JidoLiveDashboard.pages()` adds four purpose-built dashboard pages covering system health, component discovery, runtime process inspection, and distributed trace analysis.

## Purpose

Jido Live Dashboard serves as the observability layer for the Jido ecosystem. It answers: What components are registered? Which agents are running? What happened during that signal flow?

## Major Components

### Dashboard Pages
- **Home** — System status, discovery catalog summary, running agents, trace buffer stats
- **Discovery** — Tabbed browser for Actions, Agents, Skills, Sensors, and Demos
- **Runtime** — Live AgentServer process table, WorkerPool status, InstanceManager stats
- **Traces** — Telemetry event viewer with span hierarchy, measurements, and metadata

### TraceBuffer
GenServer with ETS ring buffer capturing 13 Jido telemetry event patterns with trace_id/span_id correlation, configurable buffer sizes, and automatic pruning.

### Runtime Introspection
Fault-tolerant functions for querying live Jido infrastructure: agent enumeration, state inspection, pool status, and discovery catalog queries.
