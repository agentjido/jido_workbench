## Overview

Jido Memory provides a data-driven memory layer for Jido agents with a practical ETS-backed implementation and action-based APIs.

## Purpose

Jido Memory gives agents explicit, inspectable memory operations instead of ad-hoc context mutation.

## Major Components

### Memory Models

Defines structured record and query representations for memory operations.

### Plugin

Ships an ETS plugin that can be mounted into agents for runtime memory behavior.

### Memory Actions

Exposes remember/recall/forget actions to compose memory workflows with the broader Jido action system.
