## Overview

Jido Chat UI is a Phoenix LiveView application surface for exercising and demonstrating Jido Chat workflows across multiple adapters.

## Purpose

Jido Chat UI gives the chat ecosystem an operator-facing and developer-facing UI for testing channel behavior, message flows, and agent participation.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Phoenix UI composition and application wiring for chat workflows.
- Depends on chat adapters and runtime packages for actual channel behavior.
- Does not define the core Jido Chat contract or publish as a standard package release target yet.

## Major Components

### LiveView Interface

Provides Phoenix LiveView screens for chat workflow interaction.

### Adapter Showcase

Wires multiple Jido Chat adapters into a single application context for validation and demos.

### Runtime Integration

Uses Jido AI, messaging, and chat packages to exercise realistic agent chat flows.
