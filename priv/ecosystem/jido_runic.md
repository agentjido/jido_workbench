## Overview

Jido Runic bridges Runic's DAG-based workflow engine with Jido's signal-driven agent framework, enabling durable, dataflow-driven agent workflows. Instead of imperative step-by-step orchestration, developers compose directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of Jido Actions that execute according to dependency order — with full provenance tracking, signal gating, and automatic parallel dispatch.

The package solves a critical gap in agent design: how to express complex, multi-step pipelines (research, ETL, content generation, etc.) as composable, inspectable graphs that integrate natively with Jido's signal routing, lifecycle hooks, and telemetry.

## Purpose

Jido Runic is the workflow composition and execution substrate for durable DAG-based orchestration.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns DAG workflow composition, scheduling, and provenance-aware execution semantics.
- Serves as orchestration substrate consumed by higher-level workflow packages.
- Does not own CLI provider adapters, runtime preflight/bootstrap policy, or session provisioning.

## Major Components

### ActionNode
Core adapter wrapping any Jido Action module as a Runic workflow node. Preserves stable content-addressed identity, introspects NimbleOptions schemas for input/output specs, and delegates execution to `Jido.Exec.run/4`.

### SignalFact
Bidirectional adapter between Jido Signals and Runic Facts, converting causality tracking into fact ancestry chains and vice versa for continuous provenance.

### SignalMatch
Runic match node gating downstream DAG execution based on Jido signal type prefix patterns for conditional workflow branches.

### Strategy
Full `Jido.Agent.Strategy` implementation powered by a Runic DAG. Converts incoming signals to facts, emits runnables as directives, and automatically advances the workflow until satisfied.

### Introspection
Provenance queries and execution summaries for walking fact ancestry chains and generating workflow state statistics.
