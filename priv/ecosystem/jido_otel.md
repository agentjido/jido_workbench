## Overview

Jido Otel integrates Jido observability events with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem so traces can flow into standard tooling stacks.

## Purpose

Jido Otel is the OTel bridge package for teams running Jido in environments with centralized tracing requirements.

## Major Components

### Tracer Bridge

Implements `Jido.Observe.Tracer` with OpenTelemetry-backed span emission.

### Attribute Mapping

Transforms Jido telemetry metadata and measurements into OTel-compatible attributes.

### Runtime Integration

Includes application wiring patterns for initializing tracing at startup.
