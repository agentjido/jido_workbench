## Overview

Jido Chat Slack connects Slack workspace conversations to the Jido Chat adapter model. It gives teams a Slack-specific transport while keeping chat workflows portable across channels.

## Purpose

Jido Chat Slack provides Slack integration for Jido Chat systems that need to ingest, normalize, and deliver messages through Slack.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Slack-specific adapter behavior and payload normalization.
- Implements the shared Jido Chat adapter surface.
- Does not own Slack workspace administration, app approval, or cross-channel policy.

## Major Components

### Slack Adapter

Handles Slack message transport and adapter behavior for chat workflows.

### Event Normalization

Maps Slack-native payloads into normalized Jido Chat structures.

### Quality Tooling

Includes package-level quality gates, coverage support, and release metadata for ongoing hardening.
