## Overview

Jido Chat Mattermost is the Mattermost transport adapter for Jido Chat. It maps Mattermost websocket events and message operations onto the shared adapter contract used across chat channels.

## Purpose

Jido Chat Mattermost provides Mattermost-specific transport behavior while preserving channel portability through the shared Jido Chat interface.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Mattermost websocket event transformation and outbound message behavior.
- Implements the common Jido Chat adapter surface for interoperability with shared chat workflows.
- Uses a standalone implementation in this repository with no external gateway library dependency.
- Does not own cross-channel chat contracts, runtime orchestration, or non-Mattermost transports.

## Major Components

### Mattermost Adapter

`Jido.Chat.Mattermost.Adapter` handles websocket ingress transformation and message delivery through Mattermost-compatible flows.

### Websocket Ingress

Uses a websocket-only ingress model and does not include webhook ingestion support.

### Event Normalization

Converts Mattermost-native event payloads into the typed normalized structures expected by Jido Chat.

### Compatibility Layer

Provides migration support for legacy channel modules while adapter-first integration patterns stabilize.
