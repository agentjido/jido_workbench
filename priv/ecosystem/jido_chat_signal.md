## Overview

Jido Chat Signal brings Signal messaging into the Jido Chat adapter family. It uses signal-cli as the integration boundary and maps Signal messages into the shared chat model.

## Purpose

Jido Chat Signal is for teams that need Signal as a channel for Jido Chat workflows while preserving a common adapter contract across chat platforms.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Signal-specific message mapping and signal-cli integration behavior.
- Implements the shared Jido Chat adapter shape.
- Does not own cross-channel runtime orchestration or Signal account provisioning.

## Major Components

### Signal Adapter

Wraps signal-cli-backed channel behavior for inbound and outbound Signal messages.

### Message Normalization

Converts Signal payloads into normalized structures expected by Jido Chat.

### Local Configuration

Uses environment-driven setup for local development and test execution.
