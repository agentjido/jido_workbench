## Overview

Jido MCP integrates MCP servers into the Jido ecosystem through pooled client connections, normalized call envelopes, and action/plugin surfaces that fit existing Jido agent workflows.

## Purpose

Jido MCP is the MCP interoperability package for connecting Jido agents to external tool/resource/prompt servers.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns MCP endpoint lifecycle, transport wiring, and normalized result envelopes.
- Exposes MCP operations through Jido-friendly APIs, actions, and plugin routes.
- Does not own provider-neutral orchestration policy, non-MCP adapter contracts, or application-specific permission governance.

## Major Components

### Endpoint Client Pool

Manages reusable MCP client connections per configured endpoint and transport.

### Consume APIs

Provides typed operations for listing/calling tools, reading resources, and retrieving prompts.

### Action and Plugin Integration

Ships Jido action modules and plugin wiring so MCP operations can be used from signal-driven agents.

### Server Bridge

Supports bridging MCP server surfaces with explicit allowlists for controlled exposure.
