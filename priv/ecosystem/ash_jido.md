## Overview

AshJido is a compile-time bridge between the Ash Framework and the Jido agent ecosystem. It adds a declarative `jido` DSL section to Ash resources that automatically generates `Jido.Action` modules from Ash actions, enabling any Ash resource to be called as an AI tool while preserving Ash's authorization policies, data layers, and type safety.

The library is intentionally thin (~400 LOC) and unopinionated — it does not auto-discover domains, inject pagination logic, or bypass Ash authorization. Instead, it provides a clean, zero-boilerplate way to expose existing Ash CRUD and custom actions to Jido agents, letting developers choose exactly which actions to surface and how they should be named and tagged for AI discovery.

## Purpose

AshJido makes any Ash Framework resource instantly usable by Jido agents. Ash is the dominant declarative data/resource framework in Elixir — by bridging it to Jido, developers can turn their existing Ash resources into AI-callable actions with a few lines of DSL configuration rather than writing manual adapter code.

## Major Components

### Spark DSL Extension
The entry point added as an extension to any Ash resource. Registers the `jido` DSL section with `action` (expose a single named Ash action) and `all_actions` (bulk-expose with filters) entity types.

### Compile-Time Transformer
A Spark DSL transformer that runs after Ash finalizes its DSL, expanding `all_actions` declarations and generating `Jido.Action` modules under a `Resource.Jido.*` namespace.

### Type Mapper
Converts Ash attribute types into NimbleOptions schema types for proper typed parameter validation in generated Jido actions.

### Result Mapper
Handles converting Ash operation results into Jido-friendly formats, with configurable struct-to-map conversion via the `output_map?` option.

### Error Translation
Converts Ash error types into Jido's Splode-based error system with field-level detail extraction.
