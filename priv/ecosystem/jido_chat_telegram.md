## Overview

Jido Chat Telegram is the Telegram transport adapter for Jido Chat. It maps Telegram updates and send operations onto the shared adapter contract used across chat channels.

## Purpose

Jido Chat Telegram provides Telegram-specific transport behavior while preserving channel portability through the shared Jido Chat interface.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Telegram update transformation, outbound send behavior, and Telegram-specific extension helpers.
- Implements the common Jido Chat adapter surface for interoperability with shared chat workflows.
- Does not own cross-channel chat contracts, runtime orchestration, or non-Telegram transports.

## Major Components

### Telegram Adapter

`Jido.Chat.Telegram.Adapter` handles update transformation and message delivery through Telegram-compatible flows.

### Extension Surface

`Jido.Chat.Telegram.Extensions` exposes Telegram-specific helpers for media sends, callback handling, and other channel-specific operations.

### Event Normalization

Converts Telegram-native payloads into the typed normalized structures expected by Jido Chat.

### Compatibility Layer

Provides migration support for legacy channel modules while adapter-first integration patterns stabilize.
