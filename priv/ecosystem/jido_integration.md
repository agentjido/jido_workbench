## Overview

Jido Integration is an Elixir integration platform for publishing connector capabilities, managing auth lifecycle, invoking work across runtime targets, and reviewing durable execution state.

The repository is a non-umbrella monorepo that contains platform contracts, connector packages, durability tiers, and proof apps for hosted webhook and async flows.

## Purpose

Jido Integration provides the higher-level connector platform for applications that need consistent discovery, authentication, invocation, review, and target lookup across provider integrations.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns connector discovery, auth lifecycle, invocation, review lookup, and hosted async/webhook APIs.
- Provides contracts and conformance workflows for connector package authors.
- Does not replace channel-specific chat adapters, lower-level Jido runtime contracts, or provider business logic outside connector operations.

## Major Components

### Public Facade

`Jido.Integration.V2` exposes the main surface for connector discovery, auth lifecycle calls, invocation, review lookups, and target lookup.

### Connector Contracts

Connector packages publish authored capability contracts and may expose generated `Jido.Action`, `Jido.Sensor`, and `Jido.Plugin` surfaces.

### Runtime And Durability

Core runtime packages support direct, session, stream, inference, async, and webhook execution paths with durable review data.

### Proof Applications

Apps under `apps/` exercise hosted webhook, async, inference, and provider-specific flows.
