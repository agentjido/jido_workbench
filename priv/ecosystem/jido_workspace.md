## Overview

Jido Workspace provides a unified artifact workspace abstraction for agent sessions, combining virtual filesystem and shell primitives.

## Purpose

Jido Workspace is the workspace state and artifact lifecycle layer for higher-level agent systems.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns workspace creation, artifact APIs, and snapshot lifecycle operations.
- Provides workspace-local execution composition using shell and VFS primitives.
- Long-term canonical ownership is still open versus `Jido.Harness.Exec.Workspace`.

## Major Components

### Workspace Core

Creates and manages workspace instances backed by VFS semantics.

### Artifact API

Supports common file operations and artifact inspection helpers.

### Snapshot Lifecycle

Allows checkpoint/restore workflows for reversible autonomous operations.

### Shell Integration

Runs commands against workspace state through jido_shell adapters.
