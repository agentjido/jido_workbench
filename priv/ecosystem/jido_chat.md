## Overview

Jido Chat is an SDK-first chat core that defines typed message structures and canonical adapter contracts for chat integrations. It provides a stable architectural center for channel packages while remaining runtime-agnostic.

## Purpose

Jido Chat is the core chat protocol and type system package for the emerging messaging adapter family in the Jido ecosystem.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns chat data models, normalization contracts, and adapter behavior interfaces.
- Provides the common contract layer that channel-specific packages build on.
- Does not own channel transport implementations, runtime orchestration policy, or provider-specific delivery behavior.

## Major Components

### Core Chat Surface

`Jido.Chat` provides the pure struct/function loop for handling incoming events and generating outbound responses.

### Typed Payloads

Defines normalized envelope and payload structs used by adapters to translate platform-specific message events.

### Adapter Contract

`Jido.Chat.Adapter` standardizes channel integration behavior so downstream packages can integrate consistently.

### Compatibility Layer

Includes migration support for legacy channel modules while the canonical adapter path matures.
