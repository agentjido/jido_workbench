## Overview

Jido Bedrock provides Bedrock-backed persistence adapters for Jido runtimes. It gives Jido agents durable storage for checkpoints and thread journals while staying inside the standard `Jido.Storage` contract.

## Purpose

Jido Bedrock is the Bedrock storage integration package for teams that need durable, shared persistence for Jido runtimes.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Bedrock-specific storage adapter behavior and data lifecycle mapping for Jido persistence operations.
- Focuses on persistence concerns only; agent orchestration and runtime control remain in core Jido packages.
- Does not replace provider-neutral runtime contracts or cross-storage governance policy.

## Major Components

### Bedrock Storage Adapter

Implements `Jido.Storage` operations backed by Bedrock repositories for runtime hibernation/thaw and journal persistence.

### Concurrency Control

Uses optimistic concurrency patterns (`expected_rev`) to protect append operations in concurrent runtime scenarios.

### Runtime Integration Surface

Provides direct wiring for Jido runtime storage configuration so existing agents can adopt durable persistence with minimal changes.
