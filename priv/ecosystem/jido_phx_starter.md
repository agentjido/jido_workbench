## Overview

Jido PHX Starter is a beginner-friendly Phoenix application for learning Jido and Jido AI in a real project. It includes working demos for agent actions, signals, directives, AI chat with tool calling, Ash/AshJido integrations, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Purpose

Jido PHX Starter gives new Jido users a concrete Phoenix app they can run locally while exploring common runtime and AI patterns.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns starter-app examples, demo routes, and local Phoenix setup guidance.
- Shows how Jido, Jido AI, and AshJido can fit into a Phoenix project.
- Does not define core package APIs and is not intended to be consumed as a library dependency.

## Major Components

### Demo Routes

Includes routes for counters, demand tracking, chat, listings, and weekend-sale workflows.

### AI Examples

Demonstrates Jido AI chat and tool-calling flows when provider API keys are available.

### Ash Integration

Shows Ash and AshJido patterns inside a normal Phoenix application structure.
