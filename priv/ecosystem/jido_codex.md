## Overview

Jido Codex adapts OpenAI Codex CLI into the Jido Harness protocol so coding-agent workflows can run through a unified provider interface.

## Purpose

Jido Codex is the Codex-specific provider adapter in the CLI-agent stack.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns Codex-specific request mapping, runtime contract wiring, and event normalization.
- Implements provider capabilities within the shared Harness contract.
- Does not define cross-provider policy, contract governance, or app-level workflow logic.

## Major Components

### Adapter

Translates Harness run requests into Codex CLI sessions and maps responses back into normalized events.

### Mapper

Normalizes streaming and lifecycle events for downstream agent orchestration.

### Operational Tasks

Includes install and compatibility checks to catch local environment issues early.
