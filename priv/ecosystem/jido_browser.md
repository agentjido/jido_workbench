## Overview

Jido Browser provides browser automation capabilities purpose-built for AI agents in the Jido ecosystem. It wraps real browser engines behind a clean adapter pattern, giving agents the ability to navigate websites, interact with page elements, extract content as LLM-friendly markdown, take screenshots, and execute JavaScript — all through 26 composable Jido Actions.

## Purpose

Jido Browser is the web browsing extension for the Jido AI agent framework. It gives Jido agents first-class ability to browse the web — navigate pages, fill forms, click buttons, wait for dynamic content, capture screenshots, and extract page content in formats optimized for LLM consumption.

## Major Components

### Core API (`JidoBrowser`)
High-level facade for all browser operations: session management, navigation, element interaction, screenshots, content extraction, and JavaScript evaluation.

### Adapters
- **Vibium** — Default adapter using WebDriver BiDi protocol with automatic Chrome management
- **Web** — Alternative adapter using Firefox/Selenium with built-in HTML-to-Markdown conversion

### Plugin (`JidoBrowser.Plugin`)
Bundles all 26 browser actions with lifecycle management, signal routing for `browser.*` patterns, and configurable viewport/timeout/headless options.

### Actions (26 modules)
Session Lifecycle, Navigation, Interaction, Waiting, Element Queries, Content Extraction, and Advanced (JavaScript evaluation).
