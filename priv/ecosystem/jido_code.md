## Overview

Jido Code is an agentic coding assistant that runs entirely in your terminal, built on the Jido autonomous agent framework. It combines LLM-powered chat with a rich set of sandboxed tools — file operations, search, shell commands, web fetching, and Livebook editing — all wrapped in an Elm Architecture TUI with real-time streaming, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and multi-session support.

Unlike hosted coding assistants, Jido Code is self-hosted and provider-agnostic. It supports Anthropic, OpenAI, and any provider registered through JidoAI, with runtime switching between models. Its multi-layered security model ensures the agent can only operate within your project's boundaries, making it safe for autonomous tool use.

## Purpose

Jido Code is the Jido ecosystem's coding agent — an interactive, terminal-based AI assistant that demonstrates the full capabilities of the Jido agent framework in a real-world developer tool. It serves as both a practical coding assistant and a reference implementation.

## Major Components

### TUI Layer
Elm Architecture terminal interface built on TermUI with conversation view, session tabs, sidebar, markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, and keyboard shortcuts.

### Agent Layer
LLMAgent wrapping JidoAI's agent system for chat interactions, streaming, tool dispatch, and conversation history. TaskAgent for isolated sub-task execution with independent LLM context.

### Tool System
16 tools with ETS-backed registry, executor with timeout enforcement, and Lua sandbox for secure script execution. Covers file read/write/edit, directory listing, search, shell, Livebook, web, todo, and task operations.

### Security Layer
Multi-layered enforcement: path validation against project boundaries, shell command allowlists, protected settings files, web domain restrictions, and Lua sandbox with restricted stdlib.

### Session System
Multi-session support with DynamicSupervisor lifecycle management, per-session state and persistence, and isolated security boundaries.
