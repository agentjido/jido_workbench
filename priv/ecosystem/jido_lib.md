## Overview

Jido Lib provides domain-oriented orchestration modules for GitHub triage and PR workflows that compose the lower-level CLI-agent runtime stack.

## Purpose

Jido Lib is the application orchestration layer for reusable GitHub workflow automation.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns domain workflows, orchestration composition, and workflow-level policy.
- Coordinates providers through Harness and adjacent runtime packages.
- Should not redefine provider contracts or permanently own shared runtime bootstrap responsibilities.

## Major Components

### GitHub Agent APIs

Includes canonical entry points for issue triage and PR bot orchestration.

### Workflow Composition

Builds on Jido action and runic primitives to model multi-step automation pipelines.

### Utility Modules

Provides practical helpers for integrating shell, workspace, and CLI-based agent components.
