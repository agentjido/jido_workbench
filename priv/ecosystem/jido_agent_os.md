## Overview

Jido AgentOS explores an OTP-native kernel for running durable Jido pods inside a host application such as Phoenix. It treats `Jido.Agent` as the unit of behavior, `Jido.Pod` as the unit of durable topology, and AgentOS as the kernel layer that runs pods.

The repository is public so the design can be followed early, but it is still a spike. The current API, module layout, DSL shape, and documentation should not be treated as stable.

## Purpose

Jido AgentOS is for exploring long-lived multi-agent backends that can do useful work over time, such as coding, research, workflow, or operational agent teams.

## Boundary Lines

- Owns the experimental kernel and pod-hosting model above core Jido agents.
- Provides guidance for Phoenix and other host applications that wrap durable agent backends.
- Does not replace `Jido.Agent`, `Jido.Pod`, or the lower-level Jido runtime contracts.

## Major Components

### Kernel Model

Defines the conceptual host layer that supervises and operates durable pod topologies inside a larger application.

### Pod Runtime Exploration

Explores how a durable pod can act as the boundary line for a coherent agent team.

### Phoenix Host Pattern

Documents how Phoenix can act as the product shell while a sibling runtime namespace owns long-lived agent backend behavior.
