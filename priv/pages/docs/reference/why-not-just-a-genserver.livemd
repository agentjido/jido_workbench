GenServer is the natural starting point for stateful processes in Elixir. It gives you a process, a mailbox, and state management - which is enough for many problems. Jido builds on top of OTP by separating what an agent decides from how the runtime executes it.

## What GenServer gives you

GenServer provides process isolation, message serialization, supervision tree integration, and hot code upgrades out of the box. For single-responsibility processes with straightforward state, it is the right choice.

You define callbacks, receive messages, and return updated state. The BEAM handles the rest. This model scales well when each process owns one concern.

## Where it gets complicated

Problems appear when a single callback mixes validation, persistence, and side effects. Consider an order processing server:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_call({:process_order, order}, _from, state) do
    case validate_order(order) do
      {:ok, valid} ->
        {:ok, _} = MyApp.Repo.insert(valid)
        MyApp.Mailer.send_confirmation(valid)
        new_state = Map.put(state, :last_order, valid)
        {:reply, {:ok, valid}, new_state}

      {:error, reason} ->
        {:reply, {:error, reason}, state}
    end
  end
end
```

If the database write succeeds but the email fails, what state is the process in? The state update already happened in memory, but `send_confirmation` raised. The supervisor restarts the process, but the side effect is partially applied.

This is not a GenServer flaw. It is a design pressure that grows with every concern you add to a callback. Validation, persistence, notification, and state transition are four separate responsibilities sharing one function body.

## How Jido separates concerns

With Jido, the same logic becomes a pure action that returns state changes and directives:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ProcessOrder do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "process_order",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      order_id: Zoi.string(),
      total: Zoi.float()
    })

  @impl true
  def run(params, _context) do
    signal = Jido.Signal.new!(
      "order.processed",
      %{order_id: params.order_id},
      source: "/orders"
    )

    {:ok, %{last_order: params.order_id, status: :processed},
     %Jido.Agent.Directive.Emit{signal: signal}}
  end
end
```

The state transition is pure. Side effects are described as directives, not executed inline. The runtime decides when and how to apply them.

## What you gain

- **Testability** - call `cmd/2` with any agent state and assert on the returned state and directives. No process needed.
- **Replayability** - same input always produces same output. Debug by replaying the command.
- **Effect isolation** - side effects happen in the runtime, not in your logic. Failures are contained.
- **Schema validation** - state shape is enforced at every transition, not just initialization.
- **Composability** - chain actions freely. Open validation means outputs flow between actions without boilerplate.
- **Strategy pluggability** - swap execution models (direct, AI reasoning, behavior trees) without changing agent code.

## When to reach for Jido

**Use a plain GenServer** when you have a single-responsibility process with simple state and no composition needs. A cache, a rate limiter, or a connection pool are good examples.

**Use Jido** when you need multi-step workflows, validated state transitions, effect isolation, pluggable strategies, or AI integration.

A rule of thumb: if your GenServer's `handle_call` does more than one thing (validates + persists + notifies), Jido's separation will pay off.

## They work together

Jido does not replace GenServer. It builds on it. `Jido.AgentServer` is a GenServer. You still get supervision, process isolation, and all the BEAM guarantees.

Jido adds structure on top of OTP: typed state, deterministic transitions, signal routing, and directive-based effects. The process model stays the same. The execution model becomes composable.
