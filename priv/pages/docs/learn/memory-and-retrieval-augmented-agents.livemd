## Prerequisites

Complete [Task planning and execution](/docs/learn/task-planning-and-execution) before starting. You need a working understanding of stateful agents, Memory spaces, and `cmd/2`.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}},
  {{mix_dep:jido_ai}},
  {{mix_dep:req_llm}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

This tutorial runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

## Why memory matters

A stateless Agent loses all context between turns. Ask it a question, get an answer, ask a follow-up, and it has no idea what you said before. Every interaction starts from zero.

Jido provides three complementary memory layers to solve this:

- **Memory Plugin** stores structured data in named Spaces (key-value maps or ordered lists).
- **Thread Plugin** maintains an append-only conversation log with typed entries.
- **Retrieval Store** enables semantic recall over a corpus of text documents.

Each layer solves a different problem. You can use them independently or combine all three for a retrieval-augmented Agent.

## Memory Plugin

The Memory Plugin stores structured data under `agent.state[:__memory__]`, organized into named Spaces. Each Space holds either a map (for key-value lookups) or a list (for ordered collections).

Define an Agent and initialize Memory with `ensure/1`:

```elixir
alias Jido.Memory.Agent, as: MemAgent

defmodule MyApp.MemoryAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "memory_agent",
    description: "Agent with structured memory"
end

agent = MyApp.MemoryAgent.new()
agent = MemAgent.ensure(agent)
```

### Key-value Spaces

Use `put_in_space/4` and `get_in_space/3` for map-based storage. Spaces must already exist, so initialize them with `ensure_space/3` first:

```elixir
agent = MemAgent.ensure_space(agent, :prefs, %{})

agent = MemAgent.put_in_space(agent, :prefs, :theme, "dark")
agent = MemAgent.put_in_space(agent, :prefs, :language, "en")

MemAgent.get_in_space(agent, :prefs, :theme)
# => "dark"
```

### List Spaces

Use `append_to_space/3` for ordered collections. Initialize the Space with a list:

```elixir
agent = MemAgent.ensure_space(agent, :notes, [])

agent = MemAgent.append_to_space(agent, :notes, %{id: "n1", text: "Check sensor readings"})
agent = MemAgent.append_to_space(agent, :notes, %{id: "n2", text: "Update firmware"})

notes_space = MemAgent.space(agent, :notes)
length(notes_space.data)
# => 2
```

### Inspecting Memory

`spaces/1` returns the full map of all named Spaces. Each Space tracks its own revision counter:

```elixir
all_spaces = MemAgent.spaces(agent)
Map.keys(all_spaces)
# => [:notes, :prefs]
```

## Thread Plugin

The Thread Plugin maintains an append-only log stored at `agent.state[:__thread__]`. Each entry has a `kind` atom and a `payload` map. The Thread auto-increments sequence numbers and revision counters.

```elixir
alias Jido.Thread.Agent, as: ThreadAgent

agent = MyApp.MemoryAgent.new()
agent = ThreadAgent.ensure(agent, metadata: %{user_id: "u1"})
```

Append entries and retrieve the Thread:

```elixir
agent =
  ThreadAgent.append(agent, %{
    kind: :message,
    payload: %{role: "user", content: "What sensors are online?"}
  })

agent =
  ThreadAgent.append(agent, %{
    kind: :message,
    payload: %{role: "assistant", content: "Three sensors reporting."}
  })

ThreadAgent.has_thread?(agent)
# => true
```

Filter entries by kind to extract just the conversation messages:

```elixir
thread = ThreadAgent.get(agent)
messages = Jido.Thread.filter_by_kind(thread, :message)
length(messages)
# => 2
```

The Thread supports any `kind` you define. Use `:tool_call` for tool invocations, `:system` for internal events, or any domain-specific atom your application needs.

## Retrieval Store

The Retrieval Store is an ETS-backed in-process store for semantic text recall. It uses token-overlap scoring to rank results against a query.

Upsert documents into a namespace:

```elixir
alias Jido.AI.Retrieval.Store

Store.upsert("kb", %{
  id: "doc-1",
  text: "Jido uses typed Signals for inter-agent communication.",
  metadata: %{source: "architecture"}
})

Store.upsert("kb", %{
  id: "doc-2",
  text: "Actions are pure functions that transform agent state.",
  metadata: %{source: "actions"}
})

Store.upsert("kb", %{
  id: "doc-3",
  text: "Plugins package reusable capabilities into composable modules.",
  metadata: %{source: "plugins"}
})
```

Recall relevant documents with `recall/3`. The `top_k` option limits results and `min_score` filters low-relevance matches:

```elixir
results = Store.recall("kb", "how do agents communicate", top_k: 2, min_score: 0.05)

Enum.each(results, fn r ->
  IO.puts("#{r.id} (score: #{Float.round(r.score, 3)}): #{r.text}")
end)
```

The scoring uses Jaccard similarity over tokenized terms. This works well for keyword-heavy queries without requiring an embedding model. For production use cases with large corpora, replace the Store backend with a vector database.

## Building a knowledge-aware Agent

Combine all three layers into a single Agent that retrieves relevant documents before each LLM call. This is the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern.

```
defmodule MyApp.KnowledgeAgent do
  use Jido.AI.Agent,
    name: "knowledge_agent",
    description: "RAG agent with memory and thread",
    tools: [],
    model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    max_iterations: 1,
    system_prompt: """
    You are a technical assistant. Use the provided context
    to answer questions accurately. If the context does not
    contain relevant information, say so.
    """
end
```

Before each command, recall relevant documents and inject them into the prompt context:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.KnowledgeAgent do
  use Jido.AI.Agent,
    name: "knowledge_agent",
    description: "RAG agent with memory and thread",
    tools: [],
    model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    max_iterations: 1,
    system_prompt: """
    You are a technical assistant. Use the provided context
    to answer questions accurately. If the context does not
    contain relevant information, say so.
    """

  @impl true
  def on_before_cmd(agent, {:react_start, params}) do
    query = Map.get(params, :prompt, "")
    docs = Jido.AI.Retrieval.Store.recall("kb", query, top_k: 3, min_score: 0.05)

    context_block =
      docs
      |> Enum.map(& &1.text)
      |> Enum.join("\n")

    augmented_prompt = """
    Context:
    #{context_block}

    Question: #{query}
    """

    {:ok, agent, {:react_start, Map.put(params, :prompt, augmented_prompt)}}
  end

  def on_before_cmd(agent, action), do: super(agent, action)
end
```

The `on_before_cmd/2` hook fires before each reasoning step. It queries the Retrieval Store, formats matching documents into a context block, and prepends it to the user's prompt. The LLM sees the relevant documents as part of its input without any changes to the model or tool configuration.

## Checkpoint and restore

When persisting Agent state, each Plugin controls what happens to its state slice through the `on_checkpoint/2` callback. Three strategies are available:

- `:keep` includes the state in the checkpoint as-is.
- `:drop` excludes the state entirely (for transient data like caches).
- `{:externalize, key, pointer}` replaces the full state with a lightweight pointer.

### Built-in Plugin behavior

The Memory Plugin defaults to `:keep`, serializing all Spaces into the checkpoint. The Thread Plugin uses `:externalize` to store only the Thread's `id` and `rev`:

```elixir
# Thread Plugin on_checkpoint (built-in):
# %Thread{id: "t-001", rev: 5} => {:externalize, :thread, %{id: "t-001", rev: 5}}
```

### Custom Plugin strategies

Write Plugins that control their own checkpoint behavior:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CachePlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "cache",
    state_key: :cache,
    actions: [],
    description: "Transient cache, dropped on checkpoint"

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def mount(_agent, _config), do: {:ok, %{}}

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def on_checkpoint(_state, _ctx), do: :drop
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SessionPlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "session",
    state_key: :session,
    actions: [],
    description: "Session state with externalized persistence"

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def mount(_agent, _config), do: {:ok, %{}}

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def on_checkpoint(%{id: session_id}, _ctx) do
    {:externalize, :session, %{id: session_id}}
  end

  def on_checkpoint(_, _ctx), do: :keep

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def on_restore(%{id: session_id}, _ctx) do
    {:ok, %{id: session_id, restored: true}}
  end
end
```

### Running a checkpoint

Wire the Plugins into an Agent and call `checkpoint/2`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CheckpointableAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "checkpointable_agent",
    plugins: [MyApp.CachePlugin, MyApp.SessionPlugin]
end

agent = MyApp.CheckpointableAgent.new()
agent = %{agent | state: Map.put(agent.state, :cache, %{tmp: "value"})}
agent = %{agent | state: Map.put(agent.state, :session, %{id: "sess-42"})}
```

```elixir
{:ok, checkpoint} = MyApp.CheckpointableAgent.checkpoint(agent, %{})
IO.inspect(checkpoint, label: "Checkpoint")
```

The checkpoint map contains:

- `state` with `:cache` removed (`:drop`) and `:session` removed (externalized)
- `session: %{id: "sess-42"}` as the externalized pointer
- `externalized_keys` mapping `:session` back to `:session`

Restore rebuilds the Agent and calls `on_restore/2` for each externalized Plugin:

```elixir
{:ok, restored} = MyApp.CheckpointableAgent.restore(checkpoint, %{})
IO.inspect(restored.state, label: "Restored state")
# session state has restored: true from on_restore/2
```
