## Prerequisites

Complete [Parent-child agent hierarchies](/docs/learn/parent-child-agent-hierarchies) before starting this tutorial. You should be comfortable with Agents, Actions, Signals, and the Jido runtime.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

This tutorial runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

## Why sensors

Agents are reactive. They sit idle until a Signal arrives, then run the matching Action. This works when signals originate from within your system, but most real applications need external data: API polling, webhooks, message queues, file watchers.

A Sensor bridges external events into the Signal model. It is a GenServer that fetches or receives data, wraps it in a Signal, and delivers it to an Agent. The Agent does not know or care where the Signal came from. It matches on the Signal type and runs the appropriate Action.

## Define the actions

Start with two Actions. `HandleQuoteAction` processes incoming quotes from a polling Sensor. `HandleWebhookAction` handles webhook payloads delivered as Signals.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.HandleQuoteAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "handle_quote",
    schema: [
      quote: [type: :string, required: true],
      category: [type: :string, default: "general"],
      emit_count: [type: :integer, default: 0],
      sensor_id: [type: :string, default: "unknown"]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    current_quotes = Map.get(context.state, :quotes, [])

    quote_entry = %{
      quote: params.quote,
      category: params.category,
      emit_count: params.emit_count,
      sensor_id: params.sensor_id,
      received_at: DateTime.utc_now()
    }

    {:ok, %{quotes: [quote_entry | current_quotes]}}
  end
end
```

Each quote is prepended to the list in agent state. The Action reads existing quotes from `context.state` and returns the updated list.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.HandleWebhookAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "handle_webhook",
    schema: [
      event: [type: :string, required: true],
      payload: [type: :map, default: %{}]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    current_events = Map.get(context.state, :events, [])

    event_entry = %{
      event: params.event,
      payload: params.payload,
      received_at: DateTime.utc_now()
    }

    {:ok, %{events: [event_entry | current_events]}}
  end
end
```

Both Actions follow the same pattern: read current state, build a new entry, return an updated list. The runtime merges the result into agent state.

## Build a sensor

A Sensor is a GenServer that polls an external source on a timer and emits Signals to a target Agent. This one cycles through a list of quotes, sending one per interval.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.QuoteSensor do
  use GenServer

  @quotes [
    "The best way to predict the future is to create it.",
    "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.",
    "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
  ]

  def start_link(opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts)
  end

  def init(opts) do
    state = %{
      target: Keyword.fetch!(opts, :target),
      interval_ms: Keyword.get(opts, :interval_ms, 100),
      emit_count: 0,
      max_emits: Keyword.get(opts, :max_emits, 5)
    }

    send(self(), :emit)
    {:ok, state}
  end
```

The `init/1` callback stores the target Agent reference, polling interval, and maximum number of emissions. It immediately sends itself the first `:emit` message.

```elixir
  def handle_info(:emit, %{emit_count: count, max_emits: max} = state)
      when count >= max do
    {:stop, :normal, state}
  end

  def handle_info(:emit, state) do
    new_count = state.emit_count + 1

    signal =
      Jido.Signal.new!("sensor.quote", %{
        quote: Enum.at(@quotes, rem(new_count - 1, length(@quotes))),
        category: "programming",
        emit_count: new_count,
        sensor_id: "quote-sensor"
      }, source: "/sensor/quote")

    Jido.AgentServer.cast(state.target, signal)
    Process.send_after(self(), :emit, state.interval_ms)
    {:noreply, %{state | emit_count: new_count}}
  end
end
```

When `emit_count` reaches `max_emits`, the Sensor stops itself. Otherwise it builds a Signal with type `"sensor.quote"`, delivers it to the Agent via `AgentServer.cast/2`, and schedules the next emission. The `cast` call is fire-and-forget, so the Sensor does not block waiting for the Agent to process the Signal.

## Wire the agent

The Agent declares Signal Routes that map Signal types to Actions. When a Signal arrives, the runtime pattern-matches its type against the routes and runs the corresponding Action.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.EventCollectorAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "event_collector",
    schema: [
      quotes: [type: {:list, :map}, default: []],
      events: [type: {:list, :map}, default: []],
      status: [type: :atom, default: :idle]
    ]

  def signal_routes(_ctx) do
    [
      {"sensor.quote", MyApp.HandleQuoteAction},
      {"webhook.github", MyApp.HandleWebhookAction}
    ]
  end
end
```

`signal_routes/1` returns a list of `{pattern, action}` tuples. The first route matches any Signal with type `"sensor.quote"` and dispatches it to `HandleQuoteAction`. The second matches `"webhook.github"` for webhook payloads.

## Receive sensor data

Start the Jido runtime, spawn the Agent, then start the Sensor pointing at the Agent. The Sensor will emit 5 quotes at 100ms intervals.

```elixir
runtime_name = :learn_sensors
{:ok, _runtime_pid} = Jido.start_link(name: runtime_name)

{:ok, agent_pid} =
  Jido.start_agent(runtime_name, MyApp.EventCollectorAgent, id: "collector-1")
```

```elixir
{:ok, sensor_pid} =
  MyApp.QuoteSensor.start_link(
    target: agent_pid,
    interval_ms: 100,
    max_emits: 5
  )
```

The Sensor runs asynchronously. Wait for it to finish emitting, then query the Agent state.

```elixir
Process.sleep(1000)

{:ok, server_state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(agent_pid)
state = server_state.agent.state

IO.inspect(length(state.quotes), label: "Quotes received")
IO.inspect(Enum.map(state.quotes, & &1.quote), label: "Quote texts")
```

You should see 5 quotes. Each one arrived as a Signal, matched the `"sensor.quote"` route, and was processed by `HandleQuoteAction`.

## Webhook injection

You do not need a Sensor to send Signals. Any process can deliver a Signal directly to an Agent. This is how you handle webhooks: your Phoenix controller builds a Signal and sends it.

```elixir
webhook_signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!("webhook.github", %{
    event: "push",
    payload: %{
      repo: "agentjido/jido",
      branch: "main",
      commits: 3
    }
  }, source: "/webhooks/github")

Jido.AgentServer.cast(
  agent_pid,
  webhook_signal
)
```

```elixir
Process.sleep(200)

{:ok, server_state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(agent_pid)
state = server_state.agent.state

IO.inspect(state.events, label: "Webhook events")
```

The Agent processed the webhook Signal through the same routing mechanism as the Sensor data. From the Agent's perspective, both are just Signals with different types.

## Context-aware routing

`signal_routes/1` receives a context map. You can return different routes based on the Agent's current state. This lets you build Agents that change behavior dynamically.

Define Actions for normal and maintenance modes.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ProcessAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "process",
    schema: [value: [type: :integer, default: 1]]

  @impl true
  def run(%{value: value}, context) do
    current = Map.get(context.state, :counter, 0)
    {:ok, %{counter: current + value, message: "processed"}}
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.MaintenanceAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "maintenance_handler",
    schema: [value: [type: :integer, default: 0]]

  @impl true
  def run(_params, _context) do
    {:ok, %{message: "system in maintenance mode"}}
  end
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SetModeAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "set_mode",
    schema: [mode: [type: :atom, required: true]]

  @impl true
  def run(%{mode: mode}, _context) do
    {:ok, %{mode: mode}}
  end
end
```

Now define the Agent with context-aware routing. When the context includes `maintenance: true`, the `"process"` Signal routes to `MaintenanceAction` instead of `ProcessAction`.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.GatedAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "gated_agent",
    schema: [
      mode: [type: :atom, default: :normal],
      counter: [type: :integer, default: 0],
      message: [type: :string, default: nil]
    ]

  def signal_routes(ctx) do
    base_routes = [{"set_mode", MyApp.SetModeAction}]

    process_route =
      case ctx do
        %{maintenance: true} -> {"process", MyApp.MaintenanceAction}
        _ -> {"process", MyApp.ProcessAction}
      end

    [process_route | base_routes]
  end
end
```

The routing decision happens on every incoming Signal. The runtime calls `signal_routes/1` with the current context, so the Agent can gate behavior based on any context value: feature flags, agent mode, time of day, or accumulated state.

```elixir
{:ok, gated_pid} =
  Jido.start_agent(runtime_name, MyApp.GatedAgent, id: "gated-1")

agent_ref = gated_pid
```

Send a `"process"` Signal in normal mode.

```elixir
process_signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!("process", %{value: 42}, source: "/test")

Jido.AgentServer.cast(agent_ref, process_signal)
Process.sleep(200)

{:ok, server_state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(agent_ref)
state = server_state.agent.state
IO.inspect(state.counter, label: "Counter")
IO.inspect(state.message, label: "Message")
```

The counter increments because `ProcessAction` handled the Signal. Now switch to maintenance mode and send the same Signal.

```elixir
mode_signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!("set_mode", %{mode: :maintenance},
    source: "/admin"
  )

Jido.AgentServer.cast(agent_ref, mode_signal)
Process.sleep(200)
```

```elixir
Jido.AgentServer.cast(agent_ref, process_signal)
Process.sleep(200)

{:ok, server_state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(agent_ref)
state = server_state.agent.state
IO.inspect(state.counter, label: "Counter after maintenance")
IO.inspect(state.message, label: "Message after maintenance")
```

The counter stays at the previous value. `MaintenanceAction` ran instead of `ProcessAction`, returning a maintenance message without incrementing the counter.
