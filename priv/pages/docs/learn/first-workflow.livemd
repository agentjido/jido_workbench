## Prerequisites

Complete [Your first agent](/docs/getting-started/first-agent) before starting this tutorial. You need a working agent module and familiarity with single-action execution.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

This tutorial runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

## Why compose actions?

A single action that does everything is easy to write and hard to maintain. Splitting work into small actions gives you three things: isolated tests, clear failure boundaries, and reuse across agents.

Jido workflows run a list of actions in sequence. Each action returns state updates. `cmd/2` deep-merges them into agent state. The next action reads the updated state through `context.state`.

## Define the agent

The agent declares a schema that describes the shape of its state. All action results merge into this state as the workflow progresses.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "order_agent",
    description: "Processes orders through validation, discount, and total",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      order_id: Zoi.string() |> Zoi.default(""),
      validated: Zoi.boolean() |> Zoi.default(false),
      discount: Zoi.float() |> Zoi.default(0.0),
      total: Zoi.float() |> Zoi.default(0.0),
      status: Zoi.atom() |> Zoi.default(:pending)
    })
end
```

## Define the actions

Build three actions for an order processing workflow. Each action declares its inputs with a Zoi schema and returns a state map.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ValidateOrder do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "validate_order",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{order_id: Zoi.string()})

  @impl true
  def run(params, _context) do
    {:ok, %{order_id: params.order_id, validated: true}}
  end
end
```

`ValidateOrder` takes an `order_id` param and returns `validated: true`. The runtime merges this into the agent's state.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ApplyDiscount do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "apply_discount",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{})

  @impl true
  def run(_params, context) do
    discount = if context.state[:validated], do: 0.1, else: 0.0
    {:ok, %{discount: discount}}
  end
end
```

`ApplyDiscount` takes no params. It reads `validated` from `context.state`, which holds the agent's current state after prior actions ran.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CalculateTotal do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "calculate_total",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{})

  @impl true
  def run(_params, context) do
    base_price = 100.0
    total = base_price * (1.0 - context.state.discount)
    {:ok, %{order_id: context.state.order_id, total: total}}
  end
end
```

`CalculateTotal` reads `discount` and `order_id` from `context.state`. It computes the final price and returns the result for merging.

Notice the pattern: each action reads prior results from `context.state`, not from params. Params are what you pass in the `{Action, %{params}}` tuple and are validated against the action's schema.

## Chain actions with cmd/2

Create an agent struct and pass a list of action tuples to `cmd/2`. The runtime executes them in order, merging each result into the agent's state before running the next action.

```elixir
agent = MyApp.OrderAgent.new()

{agent, directives} =
  MyApp.OrderAgent.cmd(agent, [
    {MyApp.ValidateOrder, %{order_id: "ord_99"}},
    MyApp.ApplyDiscount,
    MyApp.CalculateTotal
  ])
```

The first tuple provides initial params. `ApplyDiscount` and `CalculateTotal` have no extra params, so you pass the module alone. Each action receives the latest agent state through `context.state`.

## Inspect the result

After execution, the agent struct holds the merged state from all three actions. Directives collect any side effects the actions emitted.

```elixir
IO.inspect(agent.state, label: "Final state")
IO.inspect(directives, label: "Directives")
```

You should see state containing `order_id`, `validated`, `discount`, and `total`. The values accumulate in agent state across the chain without any glue code.

## Return directives from actions

Actions can return directives alongside state updates. A directive is a struct that tells the agent runtime to perform a side effect like emitting a signal.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ConfirmOrder do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "confirm_order",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{})

  @impl true
  def run(_params, context) do
    signal = Jido.Signal.new!(
      "order.confirmed",
      %{order_id: context.state.order_id, total: context.state.total},
      source: "/orders"
    )

    {:ok, %{status: :confirmed},
     %Jido.Agent.Directive.Emit{signal: signal}}
  end
end
```

`ConfirmOrder` reads `order_id` and `total` from `context.state`, builds a signal, and returns it as an `Emit` directive. The directive appears in the second element of the `cmd/2` return tuple.

## Run the full workflow

Add `ConfirmOrder` to the end of the chain. Run the complete workflow from a fresh agent.

```elixir
agent = MyApp.OrderAgent.new()

{agent, directives} =
  MyApp.OrderAgent.cmd(agent, [
    {MyApp.ValidateOrder, %{order_id: "ord_99"}},
    MyApp.ApplyDiscount,
    MyApp.CalculateTotal,
    MyApp.ConfirmOrder
  ])
```

## Inspect directives

```elixir
IO.inspect(agent.state, label: "Final state")
IO.inspect(directives, label: "Emitted directives")
```

The state now includes `status: :confirmed`, and the directives list contains the `Emit` directive with the `order.confirmed` signal.

## Next steps

You now know how to compose actions into workflows with shared state and directive output. Read [Actions](/docs/concepts/actions) for the full action API, or continue to [Directives](/docs/concepts/directives) to learn how the runtime routes emitted signals.
