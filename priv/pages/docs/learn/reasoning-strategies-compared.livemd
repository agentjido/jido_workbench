## Prerequisites

Complete [Your first LLM agent](/docs/getting-started/first-llm-agent) before starting. This notebook is advanced, but it is still meant to run end to end in Livebook.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}},
  {{mix_dep:jido_ai}},
  {{mix_dep:req_llm}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

## Configure credentials

Set your OpenAI API key. In Livebook, add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a [Livebook Secret](https://livebook.dev/blog/secrets-in-livebook/) prefixed with `LB_`.

```elixir
openai_key = System.get_env("LB_OPENAI_API_KEY") || System.get_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

configured? =
  if is_binary(openai_key) do
    ReqLLM.put_key(:openai_api_key, openai_key)
    true
  else
    IO.puts("Set OPENAI_API_KEY as a Livebook Secret or environment variable to run this notebook.")
    false
  end
```

## Start the runtime

```elixir
case Jido.start() do
  {:ok, _} -> :ok
  {:error, {:already_started, _}} -> :ok
end

runtime = Jido.default_instance()

comparison_prompt = """
You are advising a four-person developer-tools team.

Question:
Should the team ship its new command palette this Friday, or delay two weeks?

Known facts:
- The feature is implemented and internally usable.
- Keyboard navigation has one known bug with nested menus.
- Docs are 70% complete.
- Three design partners want early access this month.
- The team can afford one patch release next week.

Return:
1. key tradeoffs
2. your recommendation
3. concrete next steps

tot_prompt = """

Return options that compare speed, product quality, and partner expectations.
"""
```

## Define the strategy agents

Each agent uses the same model and prompt domain. Only the reasoning strategy changes.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ReleaseDecisionCoTAgent do
  use Jido.AI.CoTAgent,
    name: "release_decision_cot_agent",
    description: "Explains a release decision step by step",
    model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt: """
    You are a release advisor.
    Reason step by step.
    Separate known facts, assumptions, and recommendations.
    """
end

defmodule MyApp.ReleaseDecisionToTAgent do
  use Jido.AI.ToTAgent,
    name: "release_decision_tot_agent",
    description: "Explores multiple release options before choosing",
    model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    branching_factor: 3,
    max_depth: 3,
    top_k: 3,
    min_depth: 2,
    max_nodes: 30,
    max_duration_ms: 20_000,
    max_parse_retries: 2,
    generation_prompt: """
    You generate multiple distinct rollout strategies.

    Return strict JSON only with this exact shape:
    {"thoughts":[{"id":"t1","content":"..."},{"id":"t2","content":"..."},{"id":"t3","content":"..."}]}

    Rules:
    - do not echo the user prompt
    - do not include markdown
    - each thought must be a distinct rollout strategy
    - keep each thought concise and decision-oriented
    """,
    evaluation_prompt: """

    - keys must match the provided thought IDs
    - higher scores should favor clearer tradeoffs and stronger recommendations
    """

  def format_candidates(result, limit \\ 3) do
    result
    |> Jido.AI.Reasoning.TreeOfThoughts.Result.top_candidates(limit)
    |> Enum.with_index(1)
    |> Enum.map_join("\n\n", fn {candidate, idx} ->
      score = Map.get(candidate, :score)
      content = Map.get(candidate, :content, "(no content)")

      """
      Option #{idx} (score: #{score})

      """
    end)
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.ReleaseDecisionAdaptiveAgent do
  use Jido.AI.AdaptiveAgent,
    name: "release_decision_adaptive_agent",
    description: "Selects the best reasoning strategy for a product decision",
    model: "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    default_strategy: :cot,
    available_strategies: [:cot, :tot, :trm]
end
```

## Start one agent per strategy

```elixir
agent_suffix = System.unique_integer([:positive])

{cot_pid, tot_pid, adaptive_pid} =
  if configured? do
    {:ok, cot_pid} =
      Jido.start_agent(
        runtime,
        MyApp.ReleaseDecisionCoTAgent,
        id: "release-cot-#{agent_suffix}"
      )

    {:ok, tot_pid} =
      Jido.start_agent(
        runtime,
        MyApp.ReleaseDecisionToTAgent,
        id: "release-tot-#{agent_suffix}"
      )

    {:ok, adaptive_pid} =
      Jido.start_agent(
        runtime,
        MyApp.ReleaseDecisionAdaptiveAgent,
        id: "release-adaptive-#{agent_suffix}"
      )

    {cot_pid, tot_pid, adaptive_pid}
  else
    {nil, nil, nil}
  end
```

## Chain-of-Thought

CoT is the linear baseline. It works best when you want one explicit chain of reasoning.

```elixir
cot_result =
  if configured? do
    {:ok, result} =
      MyApp.ReleaseDecisionCoTAgent.think_sync(
        cot_pid,
        comparison_prompt,
        timeout: 60_000
      )

    result
  else
    "Configure OPENAI_API_KEY to run the comparison cells."
  end

IO.puts(cot_result)
```

## Tree-of-Thoughts

ToT explores multiple branches, scores them, and returns ranked candidates instead of one linear answer.
Because it relies on strict structured intermediate output, this section surfaces parse diagnostics instead of crashing if the model fails the JSON contract.

```elixir
tot_result =
  if configured? do
    MyApp.ReleaseDecisionToTAgent.explore_sync(
      tot_pid,
      tot_prompt,
      timeout: 60_000
    )
  else
    :not_configured
  end
```

```elixir
if configured? do
  case tot_result do
    {:ok, result} ->
      IO.puts("Best answer:\n")
      IO.puts(Jido.AI.Reasoning.TreeOfThoughts.Result.best_answer(result))
      IO.puts("\nTop candidates:\n")
      IO.puts(MyApp.ReleaseDecisionToTAgent.format_candidates(result))

    {:error, reason} ->
      IO.puts("Tree-of-Thoughts returned an error instead of ranked candidates.")
      IO.inspect(reason, label: "ToT diagnostic")
  end
else
  :ok
end
```

## Adaptive

Adaptive chooses the reasoning strategy at runtime. Use it when callers should not have to pick CoT versus ToT themselves.

```elixir
adaptive_result =
  if configured? do
    {:ok, result} =
      MyApp.ReleaseDecisionAdaptiveAgent.ask_sync(
        adaptive_pid,
        comparison_prompt,
        timeout: 60_000
      )

    result
  else
    "Configure OPENAI_API_KEY to run the comparison cells."
  end

IO.puts(adaptive_result)
```

Inspect which strategy the adaptive agent selected:

```elixir
selected_strategy =
  if configured? do
    {:ok, server_state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(adaptive_pid)
    server_state.agent.state.selected_strategy
  else
    nil
  end

selected_strategy
```

## Choosing the right strategy

| Strategy | Best for | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| CoT | Linear decisions, explanation-heavy prompts, debugging | One path only |
| ToT | Comparing plans, option generation, scenario analysis | Slower and more expensive |
| Adaptive | Mixed workloads where prompt shape changes often | Adds strategy selection overhead |

Use CoT when you want a direct reasoning trace. Use ToT when you want alternatives compared. Use Adaptive when you want one public interface and do not want callers choosing strategy modules themselves.

## Outside Livebook: CLI usage

Run any strategy agent from the terminal with `mix jido_ai`:

```sh
mix jido_ai --agent MyApp.ReleaseDecisionCoTAgent "Should we ship this Friday?"
mix jido_ai --agent MyApp.ReleaseDecisionToTAgent "Compare three rollout options for this feature."
mix jido_ai --agent MyApp.ReleaseDecisionAdaptiveAgent "Should we ship or delay?"
```

## Next steps

- Compare these strategy wrappers with the general-purpose [AI agent with tools](/docs/learn/ai-agent-with-tools) guide
- Build longer-lived conversations in [Build an AI chat agent](/docs/learn/ai-chat-agent)
- Read the [Reasoning Strategies reference](/docs/reference/concepts/reasoning-strategies) for the full strategy matrix
