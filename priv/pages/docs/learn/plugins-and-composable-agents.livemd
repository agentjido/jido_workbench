## Prerequisites

Complete [Build your first workflow](/docs/learn/first-workflow) before starting this tutorial. You need a working understanding of `cmd/2`, action chaining, and how `context.state` flows between actions.

## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

This tutorial runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

## Why plugins

Agents that share capabilities end up duplicating action lists, state fields, and signal routes across modules. A Plugin packages all of that into a single reusable module: its own Actions, state slice, and signal routing table. You declare the Plugin on any Agent and the Agent gains those capabilities at compile time.

Here is the end result. Two Agents with different configurations, both gaining note-taking through one Plugin:

```
# Preview — you will build these modules step by step below
defmodule MyApp.NotesAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "notes_agent",
    plugins: [MyApp.NotesPlugin]
end

defmodule MyApp.WorkNotesAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "work_notes_agent",
    plugins: [{MyApp.NotesPlugin, %{label: "work"}}]
end
```

## Define the Actions

Each Plugin bundles Actions that operate on the Plugin's state slice. The Plugin declares a `state_key` (here `:notes`), and Actions read that slice from `context.state`.

`AddNoteAction` appends a timestamped note to the `:entries` list stored under the Plugin's state key:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.AddNoteAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "add_note",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      text: Zoi.string()
    })

  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    notes = get_in(context.state, [:notes, :entries]) || []
    note = %{text: params.text, added_at: DateTime.utc_now()}
    {:ok, %{notes: %{entries: [note | notes]}}}
  end
end
```

The return map uses the `:notes` key, which matches the Plugin's `state_key`. The runtime deep-merges this into the Agent's state.

`ClearNotesAction` resets the entries list:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ClearNotesAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "clear_notes",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{})

  @impl true
  def run(_params, _context) do
    {:ok, %{notes: %{entries: []}}}
  end
end
```

## Build the Plugin

A Plugin module declares the Actions it provides, the state key it owns, a Zoi schema for its state slice, and the signal patterns it handles.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NotesPlugin do
  use Jido.Plugin,
    name: "notes_plugin",
    state_key: :notes,
    actions: [MyApp.AddNoteAction, MyApp.ClearNotesAction],
    description: "Manages a list of notes",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      entries: Zoi.list(Zoi.any()) |> Zoi.default([])
    }),
    signal_patterns: ["notes.*"]

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def mount(_agent, config) do
    label = Map.get(config, :label, "default")
    {:ok, %{label: label}}
  end

  @impl Jido.Plugin
  def signal_routes(_config) do
    [
      {"notes.add", MyApp.AddNoteAction},
      {"notes.clear", MyApp.ClearNotesAction}
    ]
  end
end
```

Three things to note:

- `state_key: :notes` isolates this Plugin's state under `agent.state.notes`. Other Plugins cannot collide with it.
- `mount/2` runs when you call `Agent.new/1`. It receives the Agent struct and any per-Agent config, returning initial state that merges into the Plugin's slice.
- `signal_routes/1` maps signal type strings to Actions. When a `"notes.add"` Signal arrives, the router dispatches it to `MyApp.AddNoteAction`.

## Wire it to an Agent

Declare the Plugin in the Agent's `plugins` list. No other configuration is needed for the default case.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NotesAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "notes_agent",
    plugins: [MyApp.NotesPlugin]
end
```

Create an Agent struct and inspect its initial state. The Plugin's `mount/2` callback has already run, setting up the `:notes` slice with default values:

```elixir
agent = MyApp.NotesAgent.new()
IO.inspect(agent.state.notes, label: "Initial notes state")
```

You should see `entries: []` and `label: "default"` in the notes state.

## Plugin configuration

To customize a Plugin per Agent, pass a `{Module, config_map}` tuple. The config map flows through `mount/2` as the second argument.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.WorkNotesAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "work_notes_agent",
    plugins: [{MyApp.NotesPlugin, %{label: "work"}}]
end
```

```elixir
work_agent = MyApp.WorkNotesAgent.new()
IO.inspect(work_agent.state.notes, label: "Work notes state")
```

The label is now `"work"` instead of `"default"`. Both Agents share the same Plugin module but carry independent state and configuration.

## Use the Plugin

### Direct execution with cmd/2

You can call Plugin Actions directly through `cmd/2`, the same way you call any Action. Add two notes and inspect the accumulated state:

```elixir
agent = MyApp.NotesAgent.new()

{agent, _directives} =
  MyApp.NotesAgent.cmd(agent, [
    {MyApp.AddNoteAction, %{text: "Buy groceries"}},
    {MyApp.AddNoteAction, %{text: "Review PR #42"}}
  ])

IO.inspect(agent.state.notes.entries, label: "After adding")
```

The entries list contains both notes in reverse insertion order (most recent first). Now clear them:

```elixir
{agent, _directives} =
  MyApp.NotesAgent.cmd(agent, MyApp.ClearNotesAction)

IO.inspect(agent.state.notes.entries, label: "After clearing")
```

The entries list is empty again.

### Signal routing through the runtime

Plugins define signal routes so you can drive Actions through Signals instead of direct `cmd/2` calls. Start a named Jido runtime, spawn an Agent process under that runtime by name, and send Signals:

```elixir
runtime_name = :learn_plugins
{:ok, _runtime_pid} = Jido.start_link(name: runtime_name)

{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.start_agent(runtime_name, MyApp.NotesAgent, id: "notes-demo")
```

`Jido.start_link/1` returns the supervisor pid, but `Jido.start_agent/3` expects the runtime instance name, not that pid.

Send a `"notes.add"` Signal. The router matches it to `MyApp.AddNoteAction` through the Plugin's `signal_routes/1`:

```elixir
signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!(
    "notes.add",
    %{text: "Signal-routed note"},
    source: "/tutorial"
  )

{:ok, agent} = Jido.AgentServer.call(pid, signal)
IO.inspect(agent.state.notes.entries, label: "After signal")
```

Add a second note and then clear all notes through Signals:

```elixir
add_signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!(
    "notes.add",
    %{text: "Another note via signal"},
    source: "/tutorial"
  )

{:ok, agent} = Jido.AgentServer.call(pid, add_signal)

IO.inspect(
  length(agent.state.notes.entries),
  label: "Note count"
)
```

```elixir
clear_signal =
  Jido.Signal.new!(
    "notes.clear",
    %{},
    source: "/tutorial"
  )

{:ok, agent} = Jido.AgentServer.call(pid, clear_signal)
IO.inspect(agent.state.notes.entries, label: "After clear")
```

Both paths (`cmd/2` and Signal routing) produce identical state transitions. Use `cmd/2` when you have a direct reference to the Agent struct. Use Signals when the Agent runs as a supervised process and you want decoupled, type-based dispatch.
