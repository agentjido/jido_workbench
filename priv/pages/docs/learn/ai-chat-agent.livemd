## Setup

This notebook is self-contained. Install the dependencies, configure a provider key, start one chat agent, then send multiple turns to that same process. That is the core beginner pattern for chat in Jido.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}},
  {{mix_dep:jido_ai}},
  {{mix_dep:req_llm}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

## Configure credentials

In Livebook, store `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a secret. Livebook exposes it as `LB_OPENAI_API_KEY`, so the cell below checks both names.

```elixir
openai_key = System.get_env("LB_OPENAI_API_KEY") || System.get_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

configured? =
  if is_binary(openai_key) do
    ReqLLM.put_key(:openai_api_key, openai_key)
    true
  else
    IO.puts("Set OPENAI_API_KEY or LB_OPENAI_API_KEY before running the chat cells.")
    false
  end
```

## Define the chat agent

For a basic chat flow, keep the agent small: no tools, a short system prompt, and the standard `Jido.AI.Agent` interface.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ChatAgent do
  use Jido.AI.Agent,
    name: "chat_agent",
    description: "Multi-turn chat agent",
    tools: [],
    model: :fast,
    system_prompt: """
    You are a concise, friendly chat assistant.
    Ask a short clarifying question when the user is ambiguous.
    Keep answers under 6 sentences unless asked to be detailed.
    """
end
```

You do not need custom hooks to get multi-turn chat. Reuse the same agent process across turns and Jido keeps the conversation context for you.

## Start the runtime and agent

```elixir
{:ok, _} = Jido.start()
runtime = Jido.default_instance()
agent_id = "chat-demo-#{System.unique_integer([:positive])}"

{:ok, pid} = Jido.start_agent(runtime, MyApp.ChatAgent, id: agent_id)
```

## First turn

Use a prompt that makes the follow-up easy to verify.

```elixir
first_turn =
  if configured? do
    MyApp.ChatAgent.ask_sync(
      pid,
      "My name is Casey and I'm building a support bot for a weather app. Remember both.",
      timeout: 30_000
    )
  else
    {:skip, :no_openai_key}
  end

IO.inspect(first_turn, label: "First turn")
```

## Second turn on the same pid

The only difference is that you reuse the same `pid`. That is what makes the conversation multi-turn.

```elixir
second_turn =
  if configured? do
    MyApp.ChatAgent.ask_sync(
      pid,
      "What name and project did I ask you to remember?",
      timeout: 30_000
    )
  else
    {:skip, :no_openai_key}
  end

IO.inspect(second_turn, label: "Second turn")
```

If the second response repeats Casey and the support bot project, the multi-turn flow is working.

## Inspect the stored conversation

Success first, inspection second: once the turns work, inspect the runtime snapshot to see the message history Jido kept for that agent process.

```elixir
conversation =
  case Jido.AgentServer.status(pid) do
    {:ok, status} ->
      status.snapshot.details[:conversation] || []

    other ->
      other
  end

IO.inspect(conversation, label: "Conversation")
```

The `conversation` list should include the system prompt plus the user and assistant turns you just sent.

## Update the system prompt at runtime

Inside `use Jido.AI.Agent`, `system_prompt:` is compile-time configuration. When you need runtime values like today's date, update the running agent instead of trying to interpolate them into the module definition.

```elixir
today = Date.utc_today()

{:ok, _agent} =
  Jido.AI.set_system_prompt(
    pid,
    "You are a concise, friendly chat assistant. Today's date is #{today}."
  )
```

After that update, the next turn will use the new system prompt.

## Stream partial text while a turn is running

`ask/3` starts an asynchronous request. Poll `Jido.AgentServer.status/1` and read `status.snapshot.details.streaming_text` to display partial text as it arrives.

```elixir
streamed_reply =
  if configured? do
    {:ok, request} =
      MyApp.ChatAgent.ask(
        pid,
        "Give me a short four-step deployment checklist for a new chat feature.",
        timeout: 30_000
      )

    Stream.repeatedly(fn ->
      Process.sleep(150)
      {:ok, status} = Jido.AgentServer.status(pid)
      status.snapshot
    end)
    |> Enum.reduce_while("", fn snap, streamed_so_far ->
      current = snap.details[:streaming_text] || ""
      delta = String.replace_prefix(current, streamed_so_far, "")

      if delta != "" do
        IO.write(delta)
      end

      if snap.done? do
        IO.puts("")
        {:halt, MyApp.ChatAgent.await(request, timeout: 30_000)}
      else
        {:cont, current}
      end
    end)
  else
    {:skip, :no_openai_key}
  end

IO.inspect(streamed_reply, label: "Streamed reply")
```

This is real partial text streaming, not just completion polling.

## Which surface should you use?

Start with `Jido.AI.Plugins.Chat` when you only need a chat capability on an existing agent. Stay with `Jido.AI.Agent` when you want a dedicated chat agent, custom tool lists, or more control over how the agent is configured.

## Verification

1. Run the first turn and confirm it returns `{:ok, text}`.
2. Run the second turn on the same `pid` and confirm it remembers Casey and the project.
3. Inspect `conversation` and confirm it includes multiple turns.
4. Run the streaming cell and confirm partial text appears before the final `{:ok, text}` result.

## What to try next

- Continue to [AI Agent with Tools](/docs/learn/ai-agent-with-tools) when the agent needs actions or external data.
- Keep the [Chat Response recipe](/docs/guides/cookbook/chat-response) handy for the smallest possible request-response example.
- Revisit [Your first LLM agent](/docs/getting-started/first-llm-agent) if you need to adjust provider setup or the runtime pattern.
