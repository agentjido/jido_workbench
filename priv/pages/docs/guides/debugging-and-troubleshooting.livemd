## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)

Jido.start()
runtime = Jido.default_instance()
```

Define a minimal agent for the examples in this guide.

This guide runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter_agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0],
      status: [type: :atom, default: :idle]
    ]
end
```

## Debug levels

Jido has three instance-wide debug levels that control logging verbosity and event capture across all agents in that instance.

| Level | Logging | Argument display | Debug events |
|-------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| `:off` | Configured defaults | N/A | None |
| `:on` | `:debug` | Keys only | Minimal |
| `:verbose` | `:trace` | Full values | All |

Toggle the level at runtime with `Jido.debug/1`.

```elixir
Jido.debug(:on)
```

Check the current level by calling `Jido.debug/0`.

```elixir
Jido.debug()
```

When you need to see full argument values including sensitive fields, disable redaction.

```elixir
Jido.debug(:on, redact: false)
```

Turn debug mode off when you are done investigating.

```elixir
Jido.debug(:off)
```

> **Warning:** Never leave `redact: false` enabled in production. It exposes sensitive values in log output.

## Per-agent debug mode

Instance-level debug controls verbosity globally. Per-agent debug enables a ring buffer on a specific `AgentServer` process that records internal events as they happen.

### Enable at start

Pass `debug: true` when starting the agent server.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Jido.start_agent(
  runtime,
  MyApp.CounterAgent,
  debug: true
)
```

### Enable at runtime

Toggle debug mode on an already-running agent server.

```elixir
:ok = Jido.AgentServer.set_debug(pid, true)
```

The ring buffer holds up to 500 events. When the buffer fills, the oldest events are dropped.

## Reading the event buffer

Retrieve events from the ring buffer with `recent_events/2`. Events arrive newest-first.

```elixir
{:ok, events} = Jido.AgentServer.recent_events(pid, limit: 10)
```

Each event is a map with three keys.

```elixir
%{
  at: -576460734,
  type: :signal_received,
  data: %{signal_type: "counter.increment"}
}
```

The `:at` value is a monotonic timestamp in milliseconds. Use it for relative timing between events, not absolute wall-clock time.

### Event types

| Type | Recorded when |
|------|--------------|
| `:signal_received` | A signal arrives at the agent server |
| `:directive_started` | A directive begins execution |

### Filter by event type

Pattern match on the event list to find specific issues.

```elixir
{:ok, events} = Jido.AgentServer.recent_events(pid)

signals = Enum.filter(events, &(&1.type == :signal_received))
directives = Enum.filter(events, &(&1.type == :directive_started))
```

If debug mode is off, `recent_events/2` returns `{:error, :debug_not_enabled}`.

## Instance-level debug status

Inspect the full debug configuration for an instance with `Jido.Debug.status/1`.

```elixir
Jido.Debug.status(runtime)
```

This returns a map with the current level and all active overrides.

```elixir
%{
  level: :on,
  overrides: %{
    telemetry_log_level: :debug,
    telemetry_log_args: :keys_only,
    observe_log_level: :debug,
    observe_debug_events: :minimal
  }
}
```

The override keys control specific subsystems.

| Key | `:on` value | `:verbose` value | Controls |
|-----|------------|-----------------|----------|
| `telemetry_log_level` | `:debug` | `:trace` | Logger level for telemetry events |
| `telemetry_log_args` | `:keys_only` | `:full` | How action arguments appear in logs |
| `observe_log_level` | `:debug` | `:debug` | Logger level for the observer |
| `observe_debug_events` | `:minimal` | `:all` | Which debug events are emitted |

Named instances expose this as `MyApp.Jido.debug_status/0`.

## Timeout diagnostics

When `Jido.AgentServer.await_completion/2` times out, it returns a structured diagnostic map instead of a bare `:timeout` error.

```elixir
{:error, {:timeout, diagnostic}} =
  Jido.AgentServer.await_completion(pid, timeout: 5_000)
```

The diagnostic map contains five keys.

```elixir
%{
  hint: "Agent is idle but await_completion is blocking",
  server_status: :idle,
  queue_length: 0,
  iteration: nil,
  waited_ms: 5000
}
```

### Interpreting server status

| Status | Queue | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `:idle` | Empty | Agent finished processing but its state does not match the await condition |
| `:waiting` | Any | Strategy is waiting for an external response (LLM call, HTTP request) |
| `:running` | Non-empty | Agent is still processing directives |

An `:idle` timeout with an empty queue usually means the agent completed its work but did not set the expected status field. Check `state.agent.state.status` to see where it ended up.

## Querying agent state

Inspect a running agent directly without waiting for completion.

```elixir
{:ok, state} = Jido.AgentServer.state(pid)
```

The return value is the full `AgentServer.State` struct. Access the agent's domain state through `state.agent.state`.

```elixir
state.agent.state.count
state.agent.state.status
```

For a higher-level view, use `status/1` which returns a snapshot of the agent's strategy state along with process metadata.

```elixir
{:ok, agent_status} = Jido.AgentServer.status(pid)
agent_status.snapshot.status
```

## Config-driven debug

Enable debug mode through application config so it activates automatically when the instance starts. This is useful for development environments where you always want verbose output.

```elixir
Application.put_env(:my_app, MyApp.Jido, debug: true)
```

Set `:verbose` for maximum detail.

```elixir
Application.put_env(:my_app, MyApp.Jido, debug: :verbose)
```

Jido calls `Jido.Debug.maybe_enable_from_config/2` during instance initialization. The config value maps directly: `true` enables `:on` level, `:verbose` enables `:verbose` level, and any other value (or absence) keeps debug off.
