## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)

Jido.start()
runtime = Jido.default_instance()
```

Define a failing action and a simple agent to use throughout this guide.

This guide runs entirely locally. No provider keys or network calls are required.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.FailingAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "failing_action",
    description: "An action that always fails",
    schema: []

  @impl true
  def run(_params, _context) do
    {:error, "something went wrong"}
  end
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter_agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
    ]
end
```

## How errors flow

Actions return `{:error, reason}` from their `run/2` callback. The execution strategy catches the error and wraps it into a `%Jido.Agent.Directive.Error{}` struct containing a `Jido.Error` and a context atom like `:instruction`.

The agent struct is never corrupted by a failed action. `cmd/2` returns the original state alongside the error directive in its directives list.

When running inside an `AgentServer`, the server processes each `Error` directive through the configured `error_policy`. The policy decides whether to log, stop, emit a signal, or run custom recovery logic.

## Error directives from actions

When an action returns `{:error, reason}`, the strategy wraps it into a directive.

```elixir
agent = MyApp.CounterAgent.new()
{agent, directives} = MyApp.CounterAgent.cmd(agent, MyApp.FailingAction)

IO.inspect(directives, label: "Directives")
```

The directives list contains a `%Jido.Agent.Directive.Error{error: %Jido.Error{...}, context: :instruction}`. The agent's state remains unchanged.

## Handling errors in cmd/2

Pattern match on the directives list to detect errors before they reach the runtime.

```elixir
{agent, directives} = MyApp.CounterAgent.cmd(agent, MyApp.FailingAction)

errors =
  Enum.filter(directives, &match?(%Jido.Agent.Directive.Error{}, &1))

case errors do
  [] -> IO.puts("All actions succeeded")
  [%{error: err} | _] -> IO.puts("Failed: #{err.message}")
end
```

This gives you full control at the pure-function layer without needing a running `AgentServer`.

## The five error policies

Error policies apply when an agent runs inside `Jido.AgentServer`. You set the policy with the `:error_policy` option on `start_link/1`.

### :log_only (default)

Logs the error and continues processing. The agent stays alive with its state unchanged.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.AgentServer.start_link(
    jido: runtime,
    agent: MyApp.CounterAgent,
    error_policy: :log_only
  )
```

The server calls `Logger.error("Agent <id> [instruction]: something went wrong")` and moves on to the next queued signal.

### :stop_on_error

Logs the error and stops the agent process. Use this when any failure is unacceptable and the agent should not continue.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.AgentServer.start_link(
    jido: runtime,
    agent: MyApp.CounterAgent,
    error_policy: :stop_on_error
  )
```

The process exits with reason `{:agent_error, %Jido.Error{}}`. A supervisor can restart it if configured to do so.

### {:max_errors, n}

Counts errors and stops the agent after `n` accumulated failures. Errors below the threshold are logged as warnings.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.AgentServer.start_link(
    jido: runtime,
    agent: MyApp.CounterAgent,
    error_policy: {:max_errors, 5}
  )
```

Each error increments `state.error_count`. Below the limit, the server logs `"Agent <id> error 3/5: ..."` and continues. At the threshold, the process stops with reason `{:max_errors_exceeded, 5}`.

### {:emit_signal, dispatch_cfg}

Emits a `jido.agent.error` signal via `Jido.Signal.Dispatch` and continues processing. The signal includes the error message, context, and agent ID.

```elixir
{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.AgentServer.start_link(
    jido: runtime,
    agent: MyApp.CounterAgent,
    error_policy: {:emit_signal, {:pubsub, topic: "agent_errors"}}
  )
```

The dispatched signal looks like this:

```elixir
Jido.Signal.new!(
  "jido.agent.error",
  %{
    error: "something went wrong",
    context: :instruction,
    agent_id: "<id>"
  },
  source: "/agent/<id>"
)
```

The dispatch runs in a supervised task so it does not block the agent.

### Custom function

Pass a 2-arity function that receives the `%Jido.Agent.Directive.Error{}` and the server's internal `%Jido.AgentServer.State{}`. Return `{:ok, state}` to continue or `{:stop, reason, state}` to shut down.

```elixir
custom_handler = fn error_directive, state ->
  IO.puts("Custom handler: #{error_directive.error.message}")
  {:ok, state}
end

{:ok, pid} =
  Jido.AgentServer.start_link(
    jido: runtime,
    agent: MyApp.CounterAgent,
    error_policy: custom_handler
  )
```

If your function raises or throws, the error is logged and the agent continues. This prevents a buggy error handler from crashing the agent process.

## Supervision and restarts

Error policies handle expected failures - actions that return `{:error, reason}`. Unexpected crashes - exceptions, bad pattern matches, killed processes - bypass error policies entirely.

`Jido.AgentServer` processes run under a `DynamicSupervisor` with a `:one_for_one` strategy. If the GenServer process crashes, the supervisor restarts it according to its restart configuration.

Keep this distinction clear: use error policies for application-level failures you can anticipate, and rely on supervision for infrastructure-level crashes you cannot.
