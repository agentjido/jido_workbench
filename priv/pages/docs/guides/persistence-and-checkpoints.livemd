## Setup

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])

Logger.configure(level: :warning)
```

Define an agent to use throughout this guide.

This guide runs entirely locally. ETS examples stay in memory, and file adapter examples write to a local path you control.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter_agent",
    schema: [
      count: [type: :integer, default: 0],
      label: [type: :string, default: "untitled"]
    ]
end
```

## Storage adapters

Jido ships two storage adapters that implement the `Jido.Storage` behaviour. Both handle checkpoints (key-value snapshots) and thread journals (append-only logs).

### ETS storage

`Jido.Storage.ETS` stores data in-memory using ETS tables. It is the default adapter when you `use Jido, otp_app: :my_app`.

```elixir
storage = {Jido.Storage.ETS, table: :my_jido_storage}
```

This creates three ETS tables behind the scenes:

- `my_jido_storage_checkpoints` - agent state snapshots (set)
- `my_jido_storage_threads` - thread entries ordered by `{thread_id, seq}` (ordered_set)
- `my_jido_storage_thread_meta` - thread metadata (set)

Tables are created lazily on first access. All data is lost when the BEAM stops, making ETS ideal for development, testing, and transient state.

### File storage

`Jido.Storage.File` persists data to disk using a directory-based layout. State survives BEAM restarts.

```elixir
storage_path = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), "jido_guide_storage")
storage = {Jido.Storage.File, path: storage_path}
```

The adapter organizes files under the base path you choose:

```
<tmp>/jido_guide_storage/
├── checkpoints/
│   └── {key_hash}.term
└── threads/
    └── {thread_id}/
        ├── meta.term
        └── entries.log
```

Checkpoint writes are atomic - the adapter writes to a temporary file then renames it. Thread operations use `:global.trans/3` for locking to prevent concurrent corruption.

## Hibernate and thaw

The core persistence API lives in `Jido.Persist`. Call `hibernate/2` to save an agent and `thaw/3` to restore it.

### Save an agent

```elixir
agent = MyApp.CounterAgent.new(id: "counter-1", state: %{count: 42, label: "prod"})

:ok = Jido.Persist.hibernate({Jido.Storage.ETS, []}, agent)
```

The hibernate flow:

1. Extract thread from `agent.state[:__thread__]` if present
2. Flush pending thread entries to storage via `adapter.append_thread/3`
3. Remove `:__thread__` from state and store only a thread pointer (`%{id, rev}`)
4. Write the checkpoint via `adapter.put_checkpoint/3`

This invariant guarantees that checkpoints never contain full thread data - only a pointer to the persisted journal.

### Restore an agent

```elixir
{:ok, restored} = Jido.Persist.thaw({Jido.Storage.ETS, []}, MyApp.CounterAgent, "counter-1")

restored.state.count
#=> 42

restored.state.label
#=> "prod"
```

The thaw flow:

1. Load the checkpoint via `adapter.get_checkpoint/2`
2. Recreate the agent struct via `agent_module.new/1` and merge saved state
3. If the checkpoint has a thread pointer, load and reattach the thread
4. Verify the loaded thread revision matches the checkpoint pointer

If no checkpoint exists, `thaw/3` returns `{:error, :not_found}`.

## Using via a Jido instance

When you define a named Jido instance, `hibernate/1` and `thaw/2` are available directly on the module without passing storage config each time.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Jido do
  use Jido,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    storage: {Jido.Storage.File, path: Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), "jido_guide_storage")}
end
```

Start the instance, then persist and restore agents through it:

```elixir
MyApp.Jido.start_link()

agent = MyApp.CounterAgent.new(id: "counter-2", state: %{count: 99})
:ok = MyApp.Jido.hibernate(agent)

{:ok, restored} = MyApp.Jido.thaw(MyApp.CounterAgent, "counter-2")
restored.state.count
#=> 99
```

The instance reads its storage config from `__jido_storage__/0`, so all agents under the same instance share the same storage backend.

## Direct checkpoint operations

The storage adapters expose a low-level API for custom persistence needs outside of the agent lifecycle.

```elixir
adapter = Jido.Storage.ETS
opts = [table: :custom_storage]

:ok = adapter.put_checkpoint("session-abc", %{user: "jane", prefs: %{theme: "dark"}}, opts)
```

```elixir
{:ok, data} = adapter.get_checkpoint("session-abc", opts)
data.user
#=> "jane"
```

```elixir
:ok = adapter.delete_checkpoint("session-abc", opts)

:not_found = adapter.get_checkpoint("session-abc", opts)
```

Both adapters implement the same six callbacks: `get_checkpoint/2`, `put_checkpoint/3`, `delete_checkpoint/2`, `load_thread/2`, `append_thread/3`, and `delete_thread/2`.

## Thread journals

Threads are append-only journals that record what happened during agent interactions. Each entry has a `kind`, `payload`, and monotonic `seq` number.

### Append entries

```elixir
alias Jido.Thread

adapter = Jido.Storage.ETS
opts = [table: :thread_demo]

entries = [
  %{kind: :message, payload: %{role: "user", content: "Hello"}},
  %{kind: :message, payload: %{role: "assistant", content: "Hi there!"}}
]

{:ok, thread} = adapter.append_thread("conv-001", entries, opts)
thread.rev
#=> 2
```

### Load a thread

```elixir
{:ok, loaded} = adapter.load_thread("conv-001", opts)
length(loaded.entries)
#=> 2
```

If the thread does not exist, `load_thread/2` returns `:not_found`.

### Optimistic concurrency

The `:expected_rev` option prevents conflicting appends. If another process appended entries since you last read, the operation fails with `{:error, :conflict}`.

```elixir
more_entries = [%{kind: :message, payload: %{role: "user", content: "Tell me more"}}]

{:ok, updated} = adapter.append_thread("conv-001", more_entries, [{:expected_rev, 2} | opts])
updated.rev
#=> 3
```

```elixir
stale_append = adapter.append_thread("conv-001", more_entries, [{:expected_rev, 1} | opts])
#=> {:error, :conflict}
```

### Thread struct

The `%Jido.Thread{}` struct contains:

- `id` - unique thread identifier
- `rev` - monotonic revision, increments on each append
- `entries` - ordered list of `%Jido.Thread.Entry{}` structs
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - timestamps in milliseconds
- `metadata` - arbitrary metadata map
- `stats` - cached aggregates like `%{entry_count: n}`

## Choosing an adapter

| | ETS | File |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | Fast (in-memory) | Slower (disk I/O) |
| Persistence | Lost on BEAM stop | Survives restarts |
| Concurrency | Atomic ETS ops with global locks | Global locks |
| Use case | Dev, test, transient | Simple production |

Both adapters implement the `Jido.Storage` behaviour, so you can swap between them by changing a single config line. For production systems with high concurrency or replication needs, implement a custom adapter backed by PostgreSQL, Redis, or another durable store.
