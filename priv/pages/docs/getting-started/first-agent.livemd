## Setup

This notebook is self-contained. Install the dependency below and run the cells top to bottom. If you want the Mix-project setup afterward, the [Installation and setup](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide covers that path.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {{mix_dep:jido}}
])
```

## Define the agent

An agent is an immutable struct backed by a typed schema. The schema enforces types and defaults so state transitions stay consistent across runs.

```elixir
defmodule CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter_agent",
    description: "Tracks a simple counter",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      count: Zoi.integer() |> Zoi.default(0)
    })
end
```

This module provides `new/1`, `set/2`, `validate/2`, and `cmd/2`. The agent is data, not a process. You do not need to start a runtime for this first example because `cmd/2` runs directly against the agent struct.

## Define an action

Actions are the only way to change agent state. Each action defines a schema for its inputs and implements `run/2`. The first argument is validated params. The second is the execution context, which includes `context.state`, the current agent state.

```elixir
defmodule IncrementAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "increment",
    description: "Increments the counter by a specified amount",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      by: Zoi.integer() |> Zoi.default(1)
    })

  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    current = Map.get(context.state, :count, 0)
    {:ok, %{count: current + params.by}}
  end
end
```

Params are schema-validated before `run/2` is called, so `params.by` is always an integer. The return value is a partial state map that `cmd/2` merges into the agent.

## Create an agent and run a command

`cmd/2` takes the current agent and an action instruction, runs the action, and returns a two-element tuple: the updated agent and a list of directives. The original agent is unchanged.

```elixir
agent = CounterAgent.new()
```

```elixir
{updated_agent, directives} =
  CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {IncrementAction, %{by: 3}})
```

## Inspect the results

Show the success path first, then inspect the returned data.

```elixir
updated_agent.state
```

```elixir
directives
```

The directives list is empty because this action is pure. If an action needed to emit an event or schedule work, it would return `Jido.Agent.Directive` structs alongside the state changes.

## Handle validation errors

If you pass params that fail schema validation, `cmd/2` returns the original agent unchanged and a list containing a `Directive.Error` struct.

```elixir
{error_agent, error_directives} =
  CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {IncrementAction, %{by: "not_a_number"}})
```

```elixir
error_agent.state
```

```elixir
error_directives
```

The agent state remains `%{count: 0}`, the same as before the failed command. The error directive wraps a `Jido.Error` with context about what went wrong.

## Using this in a Mix project

When you move from Livebook to a Mix project, namespace your modules and place them under `lib/my_agent_app/`.

**lib/my_agent_app/counter_agent.ex**

```elixir
defmodule MyAgentApp.CounterAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "counter_agent",
    description: "Tracks a simple counter",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      count: Zoi.integer() |> Zoi.default(0)
    })
end
```

**lib/my_agent_app/increment_action.ex**

```elixir
defmodule MyAgentApp.IncrementAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "increment",
    description: "Increments the counter by a specified amount",
    schema: Zoi.object(%{
      by: Zoi.integer() |> Zoi.default(1)
    })

  @impl true
  def run(params, context) do
    current = Map.get(context.state, :count, 0)
    {:ok, %{count: current + params.by}}
  end
end
```

Then in `iex -S mix`:

```elixir
alias MyAgentApp.{CounterAgent, IncrementAction}

agent = CounterAgent.new()
{updated_agent, _directives} = CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {IncrementAction, %{by: 3}})
updated_agent.state
```

## Next steps

- Continue to [Your first LLM agent](/docs/getting-started/first-llm-agent) to add a runtime and model-backed reasoning.
- Review [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents) for the full conceptual model.
- Review [Actions](/docs/concepts/actions) for deeper action design patterns.
