# Reference

## What this solves
Reference pages capture exact contracts: APIs, config, schemas, and maturity constraints.

## When to use it
Use these pages when implementation correctness matters more than narrative walkthroughs.

## Reference pages
- [Architecture](/docs/reference/architecture)
- [Configuration](/docs/reference/configuration)
- [Glossary](/docs/reference/glossary)
- [Telemetry and observability](/docs/reference/telemetry-and-observability)
- [Data storage and pgvector](/docs/reference/data-storage-and-pgvector)
- [Migrations and upgrade paths](/docs/reference/migrations-and-upgrade-paths)
- [Architecture decision guides](/docs/reference/architecture-decision-guides)
- [Content governance and drift detection](/docs/reference/content-governance-and-drift-detection)
