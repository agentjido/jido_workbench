## LlamaIndex

[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is a Python data framework for building agentic applications, with deep strengths in data ingestion, retrieval, and context management. With 47K+ GitHub stars, it offers agent modules, step-based workflow orchestration, extensive vector store integrations, and a broad observability ecosystem spanning OpenTelemetry, Langfuse, Arize, and others. LlamaIndex targets teams building context-heavy agent systems where retrieval quality and data access are central to the application.

## Jido

Jido is an Elixir framework that models each agent as a BEAM process with deterministic state transitions, explicit side effects, and OTP supervision. It separates pure business logic from LLM interactions, giving you reproducible testing and fault isolation at the runtime level. Jido targets teams building production agent systems that need to stay up, recover from failures, and scale predictably.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Jido | LlamaIndex |
|---|---|---|
| **Language and runtime** | Elixir on the BEAM VM with preemptive scheduling, lightweight processes, and built-in distribution | Python with a rich data science ecosystem, broad integration surface, and TypeScript support |
| **Agent model** | Each agent is a supervised OTP process with explicit state schema and deterministic transitions | Agents as tool-using, memory-aware modules; workflow primitives for step-based orchestration |
| **Tool calling** | Actions as composable, typed Elixir modules with schema validation; MCP client support | Function tools and module-guided tool patterns; MCP support; extensive integration catalog |
| **Multi-agent coordination** | OTP-native process communication via GenServer calls, PubSub, and dynamic supervision trees | Multi-agent patterns through workflow composition; event-driven step coordination |
| **Failure handling** | OTP supervisors restart failed agents automatically; process isolation prevents cascading failures | Application-level error handling; workflow state management for recovery patterns |
| **Observability** | BEAM introspection (process info, message queues), Telemetry events, LiveDashboard integration | Very broad integration ecosystem: OpenTelemetry, Arize, Langfuse, AgentOps, OpenLIT, MLflow |
| **LLM provider support** | Provider-agnostic through `jido_ai`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others via unified interface | Multi-provider support with extensive model and embedding integrations |

## When to choose LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a strong choice when data retrieval and context quality are the core of your agent application. Specific scenarios where LlamaIndex fits well:

- **RAG-centric applications** where LlamaIndex's ingestion pipelines, vector store integrations, and retrieval modules provide best-in-class data plumbing.
- **Python data teams** that want to build agents alongside existing ML, data science, and analytics workflows.
- **Integration-heavy architectures** where the breadth of LlamaIndex's connector ecosystem for vector stores, data sources, and observability platforms reduces integration work.
- **Evaluation and retrieval quality** where built-in eval APIs for response correctness, retrieval relevance, and benchmark packs help you measure and improve agent performance.

## When to choose Jido

Jido is a strong choice when your agent system needs runtime reliability beyond data retrieval. Specific scenarios where Jido fits well:

- **Elixir/Erlang teams** that want agents built on the same concurrency and fault-tolerance model they use for the rest of their system.
- **Runtime-level fault isolation** where the BEAM's process model gives you automatic failure boundaries. A crashed agent cannot corrupt another agent's state.
- **Deterministic testing needs** where separating pure state logic from side effects lets you unit test agent decisions without mocking data pipelines.
- **Always-on agent systems** where OTP supervisors provide automatic restart and health monitoring, letting agents recover without manual intervention or external orchestration.
