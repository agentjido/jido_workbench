## CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) is a Python multi-agent automation framework built around two core constructs: Crews for role-based agent collaboration and Flows for event-driven workflow control. With 44K+ GitHub stars, it offers a broad tool catalog, MCP integration, and an enterprise platform (AMP) with visual builders, human-in-the-loop management, and deployment controls. CrewAI targets teams that want a pragmatic path from prototype to production with strong enterprise packaging.

## Jido

Jido is an Elixir framework that models each agent as a BEAM process with deterministic state transitions, explicit side effects, and OTP supervision. It separates pure business logic from LLM interactions, giving you reproducible testing and fault isolation at the runtime level. Jido targets teams building production agent systems that need to stay up, recover from failures, and scale predictably.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Jido | CrewAI |
|---|---|---|
| **Language and runtime** | Elixir on the BEAM VM with preemptive scheduling, lightweight processes, and built-in distribution | Python with a rich ML/AI ecosystem, broad library support, and familiarity for data science teams |
| **Agent model** | Each agent is a supervised OTP process with explicit state schema and deterministic transitions | Role-based agents with backstory, goals, and task specialization; Crews coordinate groups of agents |
| **Tool calling** | Actions as composable, typed Elixir modules with schema validation; MCP client support | Large first-party tool catalog plus MCP support (stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP) with filtering |
| **Multi-agent coordination** | OTP-native process communication via GenServer calls, PubSub, and dynamic supervision trees | Crews with sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid process models; Flows for event-driven orchestration |
| **Failure handling** | OTP supervisors restart failed agents automatically; process isolation prevents cascading failures | Try/except handling; guardrails and quality controls at the process level; enterprise HITL for recovery |
| **Observability** | BEAM introspection (process info, message queues), Telemetry events, LiveDashboard integration | Dedicated observability with multiple platform integrations; metrics for latency, quality, cost |
| **LLM provider support** | Provider-agnostic through `jido_ai`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others via unified interface | Multi-provider support with broad model compatibility |

## When to choose CrewAI

CrewAI is a strong choice when your team works in Python and wants a clear mental model for multi-agent collaboration. Specific scenarios where CrewAI fits well:

- **Python teams** that want to stay in the Python ecosystem and leverage existing ML/data science libraries alongside agent capabilities.
- **Role-based agent design** where defining agents with backstories, goals, and specialized tasks maps naturally to your problem domain.
- **Enterprise requirements** where the AMP platform provides visual builders, governance controls, security policies, and managed HITL workflows.
- **Broad tool integration** where CrewAI's large first-party tool catalog and mature MCP support reduce the work of connecting agents to external systems.

## When to choose Jido

Jido is a strong choice when you need production reliability guarantees from the runtime itself. Specific scenarios where Jido fits well:

- **Elixir/Erlang teams** that want agents built on the same concurrency and fault-tolerance model they use for the rest of their system.
- **High-availability requirements** where OTP supervisors automatically restart failed agents without manual intervention or external orchestration.
- **Deterministic testing needs** where separating pure state logic from side effects lets you unit test agent decisions without mocking LLM calls.
- **Concurrency-intensive workloads** where the BEAM's preemptive scheduler and lightweight processes handle thousands of simultaneous agents without thread-pool tuning or GIL constraints.
