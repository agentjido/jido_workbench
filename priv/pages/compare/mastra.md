## Mastra

[Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) is a full-stack TypeScript framework for building agents, workflows, memory, MCP integration, evals, and observability. With 21K+ GitHub stars, it offers one of the most product-complete TypeScript agent ecosystems, covering everything from agent APIs and graph-based workflows to a built-in Studio for testing and trace inspection. Mastra targets teams that want a single dependency for the entire agent development lifecycle in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Jido

Jido is an Elixir framework that models each agent as a BEAM process with deterministic state transitions, explicit side effects, and OTP supervision. It separates pure business logic from LLM interactions, giving you reproducible testing and fault isolation at the runtime level. Jido targets teams building production agent systems that need to stay up, recover from failures, and scale predictably.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Jido | Mastra |
|---|---|---|
| **Language and runtime** | Elixir on the BEAM VM with preemptive scheduling, lightweight processes, and built-in distribution | TypeScript on Node.js with a single-threaded event loop, broad ecosystem, and familiarity for web teams |
| **Agent model** | Each agent is a supervised OTP process with explicit state schema, deterministic transitions, and isolated side effects | Agents are TypeScript objects with tools, structured output, memory, and max-step controls |
| **Tool calling** | Actions as composable, typed Elixir modules with schema validation; MCP client support | Tools defined as TypeScript functions; built-in MCP client and server support with registry |
| **Multi-agent coordination** | OTP-native process communication via GenServer calls, PubSub, and supervision trees | Agents can call subagents and workflows; orchestration through graph-based workflow engine |
| **Failure handling** | OTP supervisors restart failed agents automatically; "let it crash" philosophy with process isolation | Try/catch error handling; workflow snapshots enable suspend/resume after failures |
| **Observability** | BEAM introspection (process info, message queues), Telemetry events, LiveDashboard integration | Built-in tracing with export to Langfuse, LangSmith, Datadog, Arize, and OpenTelemetry backends |
| **LLM provider support** | Provider-agnostic through `jido_ai`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others via unified interface | Multi-provider support through Vercel AI SDK integration |

## When to choose Mastra

Mastra is a strong choice when your team works primarily in TypeScript and wants a batteries-included framework. Specific scenarios where Mastra fits well:

- **Full-stack JavaScript teams** that want agents, workflows, memory, and observability in one package without leaving the Node.js ecosystem.
- **Rapid prototyping** where the built-in Studio, eval system, and deployment guides reduce time to first working agent.
- **Workflow-heavy applications** that benefit from Mastra's graph-based workflow engine with snapshot, suspend/resume, and human-in-the-loop patterns.
- **MCP-centric architectures** where you need both client and server MCP support with registry and OAuth integration.

## When to choose Jido

Jido is a strong choice when you need production reliability guarantees from the runtime itself. Specific scenarios where Jido fits well:

- **Elixir/Erlang teams** that want agents built on the same concurrency and fault-tolerance model they use for the rest of their system.
- **High-availability requirements** where OTP supervisors automatically restart failed agents without manual intervention or external orchestration.
- **Deterministic testing needs** where separating pure state logic from side effects lets you unit test agent decisions without mocking LLM calls.
- **Multi-agent systems at scale** where the BEAM's lightweight process model lets you run thousands of concurrent agents with preemptive scheduling and per-process garbage collection.
