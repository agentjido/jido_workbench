## Semantic Kernel

[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) is an enterprise-oriented SDK from Microsoft for building agents, orchestration pipelines, and process automation across C#, Python, and Java. With 27K+ GitHub stars, it offers a mature plugin architecture, multiple orchestration patterns (concurrent, sequential, handoff, group chat, magentic), a process framework for event-driven business workflows, and OpenTelemetry-aligned observability. Semantic Kernel targets enterprise teams that need governance, cross-language support, and integration with existing business systems.

## Jido

Jido is an Elixir framework that models each agent as a BEAM process with deterministic state transitions, explicit side effects, and OTP supervision. It separates pure business logic from LLM interactions, giving you reproducible testing and fault isolation at the runtime level. Jido targets teams building production agent systems that need to stay up, recover from failures, and scale predictably.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Jido | Semantic Kernel |
|---|---|---|
| **Language and runtime** | Elixir on the BEAM VM with preemptive scheduling, lightweight processes, and built-in distribution | C#, Python, and Java with enterprise SDK architecture and cross-language support |
| **Agent model** | Each agent is a supervised OTP process with explicit state schema and deterministic transitions | Modular agents with kernel functions, plugin capabilities, and unified orchestration interface |
| **Tool calling** | Actions as composable, typed Elixir modules with schema validation; MCP client support | Plugin architecture spanning native code, prompt templates, OpenAPI connectors, and MCP |
| **Multi-agent coordination** | OTP-native process communication via GenServer calls, PubSub, and dynamic supervision trees | Orchestration patterns: concurrent, sequential, handoff, group chat, and magentic; pattern switching without rewriting agents |
| **Failure handling** | OTP supervisors restart failed agents automatically; process isolation prevents cascading failures | Enterprise error handling patterns; process framework with event-driven step transitions |
| **Observability** | BEAM introspection (process info, message queues), Telemetry events, LiveDashboard integration | Three-pillar observability with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions; metrics for function execution and token usage |
| **LLM provider support** | Provider-agnostic through `jido_ai`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others via unified interface | Model-agnostic design with broad provider support across C#, Python, and Java |

## When to choose Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel is a strong choice when enterprise governance and cross-language support are priorities. Specific scenarios where Semantic Kernel fits well:

- **Enterprise .NET or Java teams** that need agent capabilities integrated into existing enterprise application stacks with familiar language tooling.
- **Cross-language organizations** where C#, Python, and Java teams need a shared agent SDK with consistent abstractions.
- **Plugin-heavy architectures** where the native function, OpenAPI, and MCP plugin model integrates agents with existing business services and APIs.
- **Governance-focused deployments** where Semantic Kernel's enterprise-oriented design aligns with organizational security, compliance, and operational review processes.

## When to choose Jido

Jido is a strong choice when you need runtime-level reliability rather than SDK-level abstractions. Specific scenarios where Jido fits well:

- **Elixir/Erlang teams** that want agents built on the same concurrency and fault-tolerance model they use for the rest of their system.
- **High-availability requirements** where OTP supervisors automatically restart failed agents without manual intervention or external orchestration infrastructure.
- **Deterministic testing needs** where separating pure state logic from side effects lets you unit test agent decisions without mocking plugin layers or orchestration patterns.
- **Lightweight agent processes** where the BEAM's process model lets you run thousands of concurrent agents without the overhead of enterprise SDK initialization per agent.
