## LangGraph

[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) is a low-level orchestration framework for building long-running, stateful agents using directed graph execution. Part of the LangChain ecosystem with 25K+ GitHub stars, it offers Python and TypeScript SDKs, checkpoint-based persistence, durable execution modes, and explicit human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume patterns. LangGraph targets teams that want fine-grained control over agent orchestration and are comfortable owning more of the architecture.

## Jido

Jido is an Elixir framework that models each agent as a BEAM process with deterministic state transitions, explicit side effects, and OTP supervision. It separates pure business logic from LLM interactions, giving you reproducible testing and fault isolation at the runtime level. Jido targets teams building production agent systems that need to stay up, recover from failures, and scale predictably.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Dimension | Jido | LangGraph |
|---|---|---|
| **Language and runtime** | Elixir on the BEAM VM with preemptive scheduling, lightweight processes, and built-in distribution | Python and TypeScript with a graph-based runtime that works standalone or with LangChain components |
| **Agent model** | Each agent is a supervised OTP process with explicit state schema and deterministic transitions | Agents defined as directed graphs with nodes, edges, and state reducers; Graph API and Functional API |
| **Tool calling** | Actions as composable, typed Elixir modules with schema validation; MCP client support | Tool nodes within graphs; integrates with LangChain tool abstractions and third-party providers |
| **Multi-agent coordination** | OTP-native process communication via GenServer calls, PubSub, and dynamic supervision trees | Subgraph composition for multi-agent patterns; shared state through graph state management |
| **Failure handling** | OTP supervisors restart failed agents automatically; process isolation prevents cascading failures | Checkpoint-based recovery with durable execution modes (exit, async, sync); deterministic replay from persisted state |
| **Observability** | BEAM introspection (process info, message queues), Telemetry events, LiveDashboard integration | Deep LangSmith integration for traces, runtime metrics, and eval workflows; LangGraph Studio for visual debugging |
| **LLM provider support** | Provider-agnostic through `jido_ai`, supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others via unified interface | Multi-provider through LangChain model abstractions; broad model compatibility |

## When to choose LangGraph

LangGraph is a strong choice when you need fine-grained orchestration control and are already in the LangChain ecosystem. Specific scenarios where LangGraph fits well:

- **Existing LangChain users** who want to add stateful orchestration, persistence, and human-in-the-loop patterns to their current agent code.
- **Complex workflow graphs** where explicit branching, subgraph composition, and checkpoint-based replay give you precise control over execution flow.
- **Durable execution requirements** where LangGraph's checkpoint system with configurable durability modes (exit, async, sync) matches your reliability needs.
- **LangSmith-integrated operations** where traces, evals, and deployment management through the LangSmith platform streamline your production workflow.

## When to choose Jido

Jido is a strong choice when you want durability and fault tolerance built into the runtime rather than layered on top. Specific scenarios where Jido fits well:

- **Elixir/Erlang teams** that want agents built on the same concurrency and fault-tolerance model they use for the rest of their system.
- **Runtime-level fault isolation** where the BEAM's process model gives you automatic failure boundaries. A crashed agent cannot corrupt another agent's state.
- **Deterministic testing needs** where separating pure state logic from side effects lets you unit test agent decisions without running the full graph or mocking checkpoints.
- **Always-on agent systems** where OTP supervisors provide automatic restart, health monitoring, and graceful degradation without external orchestration infrastructure.
