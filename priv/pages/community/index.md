Community is where implementation experience gets turned into reusable playbooks.
Use this section when your team has moved past first experiments and needs a shared operating model.

## How to use this section

1. Start with [Learning Paths](/community/learning-paths) to align onboarding by role.
2. Use [Adoption Playbooks](/community/adoption-playbooks) to plan change management and release gates.
3. Use [Case Studies](/community/case-studies) to compare implementation choices against concrete examples.

## Attribution and evidence policy

Community guidance in this section is grounded in assets that ship with this repository:

- Runnable examples in [Counter Agent](/examples/counter-agent) and [Demand Tracker Agent](/examples/demand-tracker-agent).
- Operational and release process docs in [Production Readiness Checklist](/docs/production-readiness-checklist) and [Incident Playbooks](/docs/incident-playbooks).
- Governance requirements in `specs/content-governance.md` (ST-CONT-001).

We do not publish anonymous usage numbers or unsupported adoption claims on these pages.

## Community operating loop

- Learn: complete one role-based path and record evidence from a runnable example.
- Adopt: ship one bounded workflow using an explicit playbook.
- Share: publish a case study with permission, implementation notes, and links to proof assets.

## Where to engage

- Ask implementation questions in [Discord](/discord).
- Report product and docs issues in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/agentjido/agentjido_xyz/issues).
- Review package choices in [Package Matrix](/ecosystem/package-matrix).

## Get Building

Start with [Learning Paths](/community/learning-paths), then apply one rollout pattern from [Adoption Playbooks](/community/adoption-playbooks).
