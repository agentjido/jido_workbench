## What you'll learn

- How multi-turn prompts preserve location context across follow-ups without repeating the city
- How a local weather tool can trigger deterministic retry/backoff behavior on a transient busy response
- How to inspect preserved context, retry events, and tool-call payloads from a real local example

## Demo note

This page now runs a real local weather assistant workflow. The weather data is deterministic and local, but the turn execution, context carryover, retry handling, and transcript are all produced by the shipped demo modules rather than a replayed transcript.
