## What you'll learn

- How deterministic routing chooses one or more specialists based on question class
- How module-backed and file-backed skills work together in one orchestration pass
- How `Jido.AI.Skill.Prompt.render/2` can describe the exact skills selected for a request

## How this demo works

This page runs **real local orchestration code**.

- It registers two module-backed specialists and loads one checked-in `SKILL.md` file with `Jido.AI.Skill.Registry.load_from_paths/1`.
- The router chooses an arithmetic, conversion, or combined specialist set for each fixed request.
- Each specialist executes local deterministic helper code, so every response is repeatable and copy-pasteable.

No API keys, LLM providers, or network access are required for this example.

## Pull the pattern into your own app

- Keep specialist skills small and explicit so routing decisions stay legible.
- Use file-backed skills when you want editable runtime instructions for one specialist.
- Render the selected skill prompt before execution if you need an auditable orchestration trace.
