## What you'll learn

- When to use direct action runtime calls instead of long-lived agent loops
- How the core action families map to practical workflows
- How to keep a runtime demo deterministic without external API keys or network access
- How to swap fixture-backed families to `Jido.AI.Actions.*` modules in your own app

## Covered action families

- LLM envelopes: fixture-backed `chat`, `complete`, and `generate_object`
- Tool calling: shipped `list_tools` / `execute_tool` plus one deterministic `call_with_tools` companion
- Planning: deterministic `plan`, `decompose`, and `prioritize`
- Reasoning: deterministic `analyze`, `infer`, `explain`, and `run_strategy`
- Retrieval: shipped `upsert_memory`, `recall_memory`, and `clear_memory`
- Quota: shipped `get_status` and `reset`

## How this demo stays deterministic

This page runs **real `Jido.Exec.run/3` calls** on every button press.

- Retrieval and quota use the shipped `Jido.AI.Actions.*` modules directly.
- Tool discovery and direct tool execution use the shipped tool-calling actions directly.
- The LLM-backed families use local fixture actions in this repo so the site demo never depends on provider credentials.

That keeps the public example truthful: the runtime surface is real, the code is local, and the outputs stay repeatable.

## Pull the pattern into your own app

In your own project, keep the same `Jido.Exec.run/3` shape and swap the fixture-backed families to the production modules from `Jido.AI.Actions.*`.

- Keep retrieval and quota as-is if the in-process stores fit your needs.
- Replace the fixture tool with your own tool Action modules.
- Replace the fixture LLM/planning/reasoning actions with the shipped `Jido.AI.Actions.*` modules once provider credentials are configured.
