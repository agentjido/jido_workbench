## What you'll learn

- How to mix local node execution with delegated child-agent nodes
- How `executor: {:child, tag}` affects workflow dispatch behavior
- How to surface parent/child handoff traces in a deterministic demo UI without starting external services

## Delegated stages

`DraftArticle` and `EditAndAssemble` are delegated to specialized child workers while early planning nodes run locally.

## Demo note

This page runs the real Runic delegation strategy path locally. The child-worker outputs are deterministic fixtures, but the handoff states, delegated runnable execution, and final article artifact come from the actual workflow and strategy commands.
