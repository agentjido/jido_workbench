## What you'll learn

- When to use SetState vs ReplaceState.
- How to remove keys and nested paths safely.
- How state operations stay pure under `cmd/2`.

## How it works

Each button executes one action that returns a specific `StateOp`.
The demo immediately renders the resulting state and logs each mutation.

## Focus

This example intentionally stays local and deterministic:

- No network
- No external services
- No background runtime required
