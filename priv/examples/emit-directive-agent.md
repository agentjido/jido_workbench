## What you'll learn

- How `%Directive.Emit{}` publishes domain events.
- How state updates and emitted signals can happen in one action.
- How to inspect emitted signals from a real runtime.

## How it works

`create_order` updates `orders` state and emits `order.created`.
`process_payment` updates `last_payment` and emits `payment.processed`.
`multi_emit` demonstrates a list of emit directives in a single action.

## call behavior

The demo sends signals through `AgentServer.call/2`, then renders:

- Updated agent state
- Captured emitted signals
- A simple execution log
