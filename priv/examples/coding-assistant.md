## What you'll learn

- How to represent a coding-agent workflow without remote model dependencies
- How to show step-by-step reasoning artifacts in a predictable UI trace
- How to keep demos production-safe while preserving product narrative

## Demo note

This example replays a fixed execution trace and patch plan. No LLM providers are called.
