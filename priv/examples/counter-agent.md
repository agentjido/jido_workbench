## What you'll learn

- How to define a Jido Agent with a typed schema
- How to write Actions with validated parameters
- How signal routing connects events to actions
- How to drive a LiveView from real agent state

## How it works

This example shows the foundational Jido pattern. The `CounterAgent` is defined as an **immutable data structure** — not a process. Each operation creates a new agent struct with updated state.

### The Agent

The counter agent declares its state schema and signal routes:

```elixir
use Jido.Agent,
  name: "counter_agent",
  schema: [
    count: [type: :integer, default: 0]
  ]

def signal_routes do
  [
    {"counter.increment", IncrementAction},
    {"counter.decrement", DecrementAction},
    {"counter.reset", ResetAction}
  ]
end
```

### Actions

Each action is a separate module with validated params and a `run/2` callback. The increment action receives the current state via context:

```elixir
use Jido.Action,
  name: "increment",
  schema: [
    by: [type: :integer, default: 1, doc: "Amount to increment by"]
  ]

def run(%{by: amount}, context) do
  current = Map.get(context.state, :count, 0)
  {:ok, %{count: current + amount}}
end
```

### LiveView Integration

The LiveView creates a new agent, then dispatches actions on each button click:

```elixir
agent = CounterAgent.new()
{new_agent, _directives} = CounterAgent.cmd(agent, {IncrementAction, %{by: 1}})
```

The agent is always an immutable struct — there's no GenServer, no PID. The LiveView holds the agent in socket assigns and re-renders when state changes.

## Key concepts

**Agents are data, not processes.** `CounterAgent.new()` returns a struct. `CounterAgent.cmd/2` returns a new struct. You choose when and how to manage the lifecycle.

**Actions are validated.** The `schema` option on each action defines parameter types and defaults. Invalid params are rejected before `run/2` is called.

**Signal routing is declarative.** The `signal_routes/0` callback maps signal types to action modules. This decouples "what happened" from "what to do about it."
