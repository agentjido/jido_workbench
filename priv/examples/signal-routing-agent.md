## What you'll learn

- How `signal_routes/1` maps signal types to action modules.
- How `AgentServer.call/2` handles request/response style updates.
- How `AgentServer.cast/2` queues async routing while state converges.
- How to inspect execution history with before/after state snapshots.

## How signal routing works

The `SignalRoutingAgent` declares three routes:

- `"increment"` → `IncrementAction`
- `"set_name"` → `SetNameAction`
- `"record_event"` → `RecordEventAction`

Each route is validated by the action schema and then applied to immutable
agent state. The LiveView keeps a running view of `counter`, `name`, and
recorded events so you can inspect behavior after every signal.

## call vs cast behavior

- **call** executes synchronously and returns the updated agent immediately.
- **cast** enqueues signals asynchronously and returns `:ok` immediately.

In this demo:

1. `call` controls let you increment, set name, and record typed events.
2. `cast burst` sends `1..N` increment signals and then shows converged state.
3. The execution log captures mode, signal type, payload, and before/after state.
