## What you'll learn

- How to split orchestration into phase 1 research and phase 2 writing
- How deterministic research richness can decide between full and slim phase-2 workflows
- How `runic.set_workflow` can hot-swap the DAG while keeping the example fully local and repeatable

## Branch behavior

- `full`: `BuildOutline -> DraftArticle -> EditAndAssemble`
- `slim`: `DraftArticle -> EditAndAssemble`

Selection is based on deterministic research summary length in the local phase-1 workflow.

## Demo note

This page now runs a real local Runic workflow. The research summaries and article outputs are deterministic fixtures, but the phase selection, workflow swap, node execution, and final artifacts all come from the real strategy pipeline.
