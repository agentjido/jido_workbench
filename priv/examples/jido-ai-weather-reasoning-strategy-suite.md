## What you'll learn

- How the same weather prompt shifts across eight reasoning strategies
- How to choose between transparent, fast, exploratory, and self-review-heavy reasoning surfaces
- How to frame this page as a strategy comparison reference instead of a single runnable example

## What this page is

This page is a deterministic comparison lab. It helps you decide which reasoning strategy to build around for a weather scenario, but it is not one copy-pasteable weather agent implementation.

The interactive tab compares fixed scenario presets, recommended strategy fits, and deterministic reference snippets. The source tab shows the actual comparison harness that powers those cards.

## Strategy set

ReAct, CoD, AoT, CoT, ToT, GoT, TRM, and Adaptive.

## How to use the comparison

Start with the preset that best matches your use case:

- short single-answer decisions like commute calls
- multi-option planning questions like trips and packing
- higher-stakes operational calls where self-review matters

Then use the comparison cards to decide whether you want:

- a transparent single path
- a quick draft
- a branching planner
- a reflected safety-first answer
- or an adaptive router that chooses for you

## Demo note

No live model or weather API call runs here. The page uses deterministic fixtures and a dedicated comparison harness so the framing matches the product surface.
