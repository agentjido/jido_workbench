## What you'll learn

- How a phase-1 Runic router can select a phase-2 DAG with real `runic.set_workflow` calls
- How route metadata (`route`, `detail_level`, `confidence`) can drive both branch choice and UI evidence
- How to expose direct, analysis, and safe outcomes without any provider or network dependency

## Route outcomes

- `:direct` -> quick answer branch
- `:analysis` -> plan + synthesis branch
- `:safe` -> fallback response branch

## Workflow shape

```text
RouteQuestion -> runic.set_workflow(route) -> DirectAnswer | AnalysisPlan -> AnalysisAnswer | SafeResponse
```

The page runs the actual Runic command surface in-process. The route decision is deterministic fixture data, but the branch selection, workflow swap, node execution, and final outputs are real local workflow transitions.

## Demo note

No LLM provider, browser session, or remote network call is required. The source tab shows the real local orchestrator, actions, and LiveView used by this page.
